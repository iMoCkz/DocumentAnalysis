 Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer
 As we prepare this year’s annual letter to shareholders, the world is confronting one of the greatest health threats of a generation, one that profoundly
impacts the global economy and all of its citizens. Our thoughts remain with the communities and individuals, including healthcare workers and first responders, most deeply hit by the COVID-19 crisis.
Throughout our history, JPMorgan Chase has built its reputation on being
there for clients, customers and communities in the most critical times. This unprecedented environment is no different. Our actions during this global crisis are essential to keeping the global economy going and will be remembered for years to come.
In these annual letters, I usually cover a range of topics, including a review of JPMorgan Chase’s principles, priorities and performance, as well as the broader geopolitical issues facing our company and the most critical public policy issues

affecting our country. When the time is right and the future is clearer, I will provide a more complete and current view on how this crisis might change our strategies around how we run the company, work with our clients and governments, and develop public policy solutions. However, right now, as we deal with the spiraling effects of this pandemic, I want to focus on what we as a bank can do to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support our colleagues, clients, customers and communities across the globe.
Looking back on the last two decades — starting from my time as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — the firm has weathered some unprecedented challenges, as we will with this current pandemic, but they did not stop us from accomplishing some extraordinary things. Once again, you should know how grateful and proud I am of our more than 200,000 employees around the world. I also want to thank Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith, our Operating Committee, our Board of Directors and our senior leaders for the exceptional leadership they have shown under the most difficult of circumstances.
We entered this crisis in a position of strength. 2019 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue and net income, as well as setting numerous other records across our lines of business. We earned $36.4 billion in net income on revenue1 of $118.7 billion, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We now have delivered record results in nine of the last 10 years2 and are confident we will continue to do so in the future, though it should be expected that our earnings will be down meaningfully in 2020. Our largest businesses grew revenue and net income for the year, while the firm continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology. We grew core loans by 2%, increased deposits overall by 5% and generally broadened market share across our businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.3 trillion for businesses, institutional clients and U.S. customers.

 JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. Approximately 100 million people in the United States own
stock, and a large percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders.
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These important investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since the JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger (15 years ago), our stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.

 The results shown above use our stock price as of December 31, 2019. If you compare that with our stock price as of March 31, 2020, you would see a dramatic change. For example, the overall stock price gain from the date of the JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger was 442% at the end of last year, but
it dropped to 252% three months later. While that’s still far better than many companies’ performance, it illustrates the volatility of returns.
Unlike past letters, the placement of charts about the performance of our lines of business and our fortress balance sheet is different — they can be found in an appendix following this letter to peruse at your leisure. Instead, I am going to focus my comments in the rest of this letter on issues that relate to our current crisis. And while I enjoy sharing my opinion on many other matters, I will avoid doing so this year.

 Within this letter, I discuss the following:
Dealing With an Extraordinary Crisis
1. We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, small businesses, midsize companies, large corporations, and state and local governments.
2. We take excellent care of our employees.
3. We make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities, especially in challenging times.
4. We are transparent with our shareholders: What they should expect regarding our financial and operating performance in 2020.
5. We are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges, we will not request any regulatory relief for ourselves.
6. We need a plan to get safely back to work.
7. We need to come together: My fervent hope for America.

 DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
A corporation – essentially any institution – is a living, breathing organism made up of people, technology, institutional knowledge and relationships and is generally organized around mission and purpose. Entering into a crisis is not the time to figure out what you want to be. You must already be a well-functioning organization prepared to rapidly mobilize your resources, take your losses and survive another day for the good of all your stakeholders.
No matter the challenge, we manage our company consistently with principles that have stood the test of time. I have written about these inviolable principles often – the need for extremely talented and motivated employees; a fortress balance sheet that allows us to invest in good times and in bad times; clear, comprehensive and accurate financial, risk and operating reporting to
let us make quick and accurate decisions; a devotion to our customers and communi- ties; and continuous investing in technology to better serve both our employees and our customers. (These principles also underlie an organization’s preparedness for tough competition – I was going to write this year that the competition is back in all of its facets. There’ll be more to come on that next year.)
We are there for our customers, employees and communities in good and bad times
– we are a port in the storm. It is in the toughest of times that we need to use our capital and liquidity to help clients – large and small. COVID-19 is one of those extraor- dinary times. Below are some of the things we are doing to help our company and our customers during this global crisis.
1. We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, small businesses, midsize companies, large corporations, and state and local governments.
First and foremost, we have to be prepared to operate under extremely adverse circumstances.
The significant economic fallout from this crisis reinforces the critical need to keep the global financial system fully functioning – and we recognize that our firm is an important part of the global economy. Therefore, we incorporate plans for resil- ience in everything we do – resilience for hurricanes, data center failures, cyber attacks and other issues. And while we had not envisioned the effects of a pandemic like this one, all of this preparation has paid off
– and we have been able to accomplish far more and far more quickly than we origi- nally thought possible. It is absolutely essential that we be up and functioning for all of our customers each and every day.
How else would we process $6 trillion in payments or buy and sell approximately
$2 trillion in securities and foreign exchange transactions for our clients on a daily basis? And how else would we raise more than
$2 trillion of credit and capital for our clients each year? Our branches, collectively, have 1 million customer visits each day, and our combined credit card and debit card transaction volume totals $1.1 trillion a year.
During this crisis, we have been utilizing our disaster recovery sites and implementing alternative work arrangements globally.
We now have more than 180,000 employees working from home (and quite effectively), including traders, bankers, portfolio managers,
8

 and operations and call center teams across the globe. We are ensuring they continue
to operate at the highest standards with the proper technological tools and access so they can serve their clients safely and seamlessly. Over the past few weeks, we have had nearly 150,000 concurrent virtual sessions – nearly five times our pre-pandemic average – and we have capacity in reserve to support signifi- cantly more demand if necessary.
We’re taking significant steps to help our consumer customers.
After Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Harvey and other devastating natural disasters around the globe, after wildfires ravaged California towns and after a number of other tragic events, we stepped up for our customers. Today, we are doing the same across the country as we work individually with customers facing COVID-19-related hardships.
We have been helping our customers, who tell us about their financial struggles as a result of the crisis, and are offering relief measures such as:
• Providing a 90-day grace period for mortgage and auto loan/lease payments and waiving any associated late fees.
• Removing minimum payment require- ments on credit cards and waiving associated late fees.
• Not reporting payment deferrals such as late payments to credit bureaus for up-to- date clients.
• Continuing to responsibly lend to qualified consumers.
• Waiving or refunding some fees, including early withdrawal fees on certificates of deposit.
You can learn more about our customer response at: www.chase.com/stayconnected.
Of our approximately 5,000 Chase branches, we have managed to keep three-quarters of them open – and safe – for our customers who need our services. In every one of our markets, almost all of our 2,300 branches with drive-up windows have remained open for business, allowing people to maintain
a safe distance. Our 17,000 bankers have continued to take appointments and proac- tively reach out to customers – helping them manage their finances and use our digital tools – often letting customers stay home.
In addition, the vast majority of our 16,850 ATMs are well-stocked and still functioning to provide needed cash to our customers. Our call centers have not fared as well;
many of them have been effectively shut down by local restrictions. As the volume of calls has increased from customers seeking assistance, hold times have also increased. We have mobilized quickly to address this issue, reminding customers that our digital self-service capabilities are always available for them to check balances, deposit checks
or make payments. Additionally, we have built new tools – digital and electronic – to allow customers to request relief without waiting for a specialist. And we are making it possible for our displaced phone specialists to work from home.
We are also taking significant action to support businesses — small, midsize and large — and state and local governments.
Clearly, some clients may be much more vulnerable than others – for example, trans- portation companies, hospitality enterprises, hospitals, utilities and, in particular, small businesses that do not have enough capital to withstand sudden and sustained down- turns in income. JPMorgan Chase Institute research reveals that 50% of small busi- nesses have less than 15 cash buffer days, reinforcing why small businesses are being heavily disrupted by the current crisis and
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS

 DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
will feel the effects for a significant period of time – even as more capital from the recent federal stimulus program reaches them.
To support businesses during this current crisis, we are doing the following:
• Prudently extending credit to businesses of all sizes for working capital and general corporate purposes. For example, in the past 60 days alone, we have extended $950 million in new loans to small businesses.
• Waiving and refunding fees for those businesses in need and finding ways
to help more small businesses through resources available at the Small Business Administration.
• Servicing clients with additional credit through revolving facilities, when appro- priate, and stepping in to try to help with credit when others can’t or won’t.
• Continuing in the ordinary course of busi- ness to sustain consumers, businesses and communities with about $500 billion of credit and capital raised every quarter.
• Continuing to maintain undrawn revolving commitments in our wholesale businesses, which totaled approximately $295 billion as of the close of business on March 31, 2020. Companies have already drawn down more than $50 billion of their revolvers to prepare themselves for the crisis (this already dramatically exceeds what happened in the global financial crisis). Many others have requested addi- tional credit, which we have been offering judiciously – more than $25 billion of new credit extensions were approved in the month of March alone.
• Continuing the issuance of bonds for highly rated companies ($85 billion) – it may surprise you that the first quarter of 2020 will be our largest quarter for invest- ment grade issuance, led by J.P. Morgan.
• Continuing to support vital institutions to keep our communities strong: Increased funding in March included, for example, $1.9 billion for hospitals and healthcare companies, $270 million for educational institutions, $360 million for nonprofits, and $240 million for state and local governments.
• Continuing to fund construction projects essential to our communities (affordable housing, food banks and grocery stores) through our $5 billion commitment.
Recognizing the extraordinary extension of new credit, mentioned above, and knowing there will be a major recession mean that we are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars of additional credit losses as we help both consumer and business customers through these difficult times. (We will provide more detail on these actions later in this letter.) Of course, we are in continual contact with our regulators about our actions and efforts.
We stand ready to assist the government in implementing stimulus package benefits to support the economy.
We applaud the speed with which the federal government and the Federal Reserve (the Fed), as well as other central banks around the world, put together a stimulus package and other funding benefits to help individ- uals, businesses, and state and local entities across the United States and beyond. Much remains to be done to assure these resources can be quickly and effectively rolled out.
We hope to be at the forefront of using this assistance to help our customers get through what is certain to be a difficult next few months. We will not use this relief funding for ourselves.

 2. We take excellent care of our employees.
Times like these reinforce that our employees are our most important asset – they are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of our company. Excellence in everything we do – from operations and technology to service and reputation – depends upon the abilities and character of our employees. Our vast and diverse team of people serves our customers and communities, builds the technology, makes the strategic decisions, manages the risks, determines our investments and drives innovation. Setting aside differing views of our complex world and the risks and oppor- tunities ahead, it is inarguable that having such an extraordinary team – people with guts, brains and enormous capabilities who can navigate whatever circumstances bring – is what ensures our future prosperity.
In last year’s letter, I wrote about the
many ways we take excellent care of our employees: competitive wages and compen- sation, 401(k) retirement benefits, health benefits and wellness programs, extensive training programs, volunteer and employee engagement opportunities, generous parental leave policies and much more.
During this pandemic, we have also taken extensive steps to protect and support our employees and their families. For example:
• We continue to pay employees who are
at home because they have had potential exposure to the virus or whose health is higher risk. Additionally, we provide paid medical leave to employees who are unwell.
• We have clinical staff internally to support our employees through this difficult time, whether it is fielding general inquiries related to COVID-19 or locating testing or other medical facilities.
• All employees are receiving five additional paid days off to help manage personal needs, which may include dependent care, child care or other issues.
• A special payment of up to $1,000 has been granted to full- and part-time employees whose job requires them to continue working on-site and generally whose annual cash compensation is less than $60,000.
• All branch employees are being paid for their regularly scheduled hours even if those hours are reduced or their branch is temporarily closed.
• For those who must go to work on-site, we are reinforcing both basic and enhanced personal and office hygiene measures
to keep them, their colleagues and their clients safe. We have modified business operations, staggered shifts, changed seating arrangements, closed buildings to nonessential visitors and provided addi- tional equipment where possible. We have also intensified nightly and daily cleaning of all offices and branches worldwide that remain open.
It’s amazing how quickly we have mobilized and implemented work-from-home and other resiliency measures – in weeks instead of months or years. There are great lessons to be learned from this experience.
While conditions may sometimes be unusual and difficult, we are functioning smoothly. In fact, over the last month in certain parts of our company, we’ve had the highest volume and transaction totals we have ever seen.
Needless to say, this success would be impos- sible without our exceptional employees, and we recognize our responsibility to support both their professional and personal lives now more than ever.

  A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE COMPANY IS A STRONGER COMPANY
While the health crisis we are facing supersedes all other topics in this year’s letter, the subject of diversity and inclusion is such an important one that I feel compelled to include it. As a firm, we have an unwavering commitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility. That’s why any instances of racist behavior and discrimination are so deeply unsettling.
Recently, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, our Co-Presidents and Chief Operating Officers, sent a note to employees about steps we’re taking to ensure our values reach all corners of our company.
Dear colleagues,
We are managing through uncertain times right now and recognize many of you are focusing much of your day on responding to the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. While this is a top priority for all of us, we want to make sure you know we haven’t lost sight of our commitment to keeping you informed about our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture. Now, more than ever, we need the best of everyone because only together will we get through these unprecedented times.
As you know, after the media reported on alleged discrimination in our firm last year, Jamie asked Gordon to lead an internal team to take a hard look at how we do business so that we could gain a deeper understanding of what more we can do to root out racism and discrimination anywhere it exists.
Challenging our people to be clear-eyed and open to change, we tasked many of our senior leaders from across the firm, from multiple lines of business and control functions, to evaluate our policies, procedures and programs firmwide, to ensure they are fair for all employees and customers. To be clear, we are looking across the whole firm and at everything we do.
As a result, we’ve identified a number of areas that, with enhanced, scaled or new programming or processes, would serve to improve our culture in important ways. For example, we focused on employee and customer complaints — examining common themes, where they originated and where opportunity exists to improve.
We also looked at how employee discretion may affect product accessibility across lines of business. We found opportunities to increase awareness about the firm’s Diversity & Inclusion strategy, and we identified a need to expand our diversity recruitment efforts to help us hire more diverse talent, and to implement mandatory firmwide training.
While this work is ongoing, here are five initial areas where work is now underway, including:
Enhancing our employee feedback process
We are looking hard at how we treat an employee complaint when it comes in. We are already working to simplify escalation channels so employees are clear on where to submit complaints, in addition to further building out our capabilities across complaints to better understand the full scope of the individual’s experience. Feedback suggests that employees are not always clear on where to submit complaints, so we are working to identify where improvements are needed.
Employees are encouraged to use existing channels to report inappropriate conduct or discrimination. We will continue to strengthen these “listening posts” and reporting channels in an effort to make sure every one of us feels safe and confident identifying and reporting inappropriate behavior.
Making it easier for customers to access products and services
We regularly review the products and services we offer to customers, and we are looking for ways to boost customer connectivity across our full spectrum of consumer products. To start, we are focusing on:
• Enhancing ease of navigating and guiding customers through our full range of products and services available across our entire branch network; and
• Re-evaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefits.
We will improve product parameters and strengthen monitoring tools to ensure the exercise of discretion works as intended.
Bolstering our hiring systems to build a more robust pipeline of diverse talent
Attracting the best talent can only be achieved through a dedicated focus on inclusive recruiting, so we are recommitting ourselves to this effort. We have made progress in this area, with programs such as Advancing Black Leaders, a program
12

  focused specifically on increased hiring, retention and development of talent from within the black community. Over the past four years, we have increased the number of black professionals in our most senior ranks, with the number of black managing directors and executive directors up by more than 50 percent.
In addition, we are expanding our specialized team dedicated to conducting more targeted outreach to recruit diverse talent. We will expand on our program to hold hiring managers and recruiters at the highest levels of the company accountable for hiring a diverse group of professionals.
Instituting required firmwide Diversity & Inclusion Training
In order to drive more diverse and inclusive behaviors amongst our leaders, managers, employees and customers, we are requiring diversity and inclusion training for all employees at various points throughout an employee lifecycle, including at the time of hire, and periodically thereafter. We expect all employees to fulfill these requirements.
Because the role of the manager is arguably the most critical role in promoting our culture deep into the organization, we will make additional manager training mandatory at the time of promotion to a people-manager role, and at the time of promotion to a senior leader role, in addition to other developmental moments for managers. We already have training in many parts of the organization, including programs like “Journey to Inclusive Teams” and the required unconscious bias training for branch managers. We will continue to enhance and embed this required training throughout the manager’s career.
We know that it is essential for managers to be inclusive leaders and we will focus on helping them recognize ways they can be intentional about inclusion as they recruit, hire, retain and develop diverse talent.
Increasing the diversity of the businesses we partner with firmwide
We are fully committed to a fair, equitable and inclusive company for our customers, our employees, our partners and our suppliers. This is part of every manager’s job, and they will be held accountable.
The diversity of the businesses we partner with across the firm is just as important as our employee diversity — from the small businesses to which we provide access to capital, to our asset managers, to our suppliers and to the companies we assist in bringing public.
We intend to increase diverse representation through structural process improvements in how we select partners and build our pipeline.
The firm will also continue to use data and research to further inform the development of products, services, employee programs and community investments that help address racial disparities in wealth building.
This all goes to say our work described above is representative of our deep commitment and is ongoing. It is not a “one
and done” event. We will remain steadfast, continue to work now and in the future, and remain ever-vigilant in our effort to maintain a culture where racism cannot live or thrive. Over the next 30 days, each business will review their current strategies and contribute a plan to bring this to life and each business will be held accountable.
Let us say again, we are all the keepers of our culture and we are committed to ensuring that ours is one where all employees and customers are treated equally and fairly, and where all of us receive the opportunity and mutual respect we deserve.
I can assure you, it did not take one particular story to make us realize that a diverse and inclusive culture is important.
We know that too many people are being left behind – particularly in the black community. The Civil War ended more than 150 years ago, and we still have not come even close to parity. We need to do more as a nation, and we have more to do as a firm.

3. We make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities, especially in challenging times.
I believe that our shareholders know
we make extraordinary efforts to lift up
our communities, both at a local level – supporting schools and work skills training, for example – and at the national level, helping to formulate policies that are good for countries. These policies affect healthcare, infrastructure, education and employment, including initiatives such as those that help people with a criminal background get a second chance.
We know that crises like COVID-19 create further inequities in society so it is even more important that we be present for those communities hit hard by the pandemic. JPMorgan Chase made a $50 million commitment to help address the immediate humanitarian crisis, as well as the long-term economic challenges people face. Funding will be deployed over time with particular focus on the most vulnerable people and communities, including:
• Immediate healthcare, food and other humanitarian relief globally;
• Help for existing nonprofit partners around the world that are responding to the crisis in their communities;
• Assistance to small businesses vulnerable to significant economic hardships in the United States, China and Europe.
There is a tremendous amount we do day to day – in addition to traditional banking – to help the communities in which we operate, including the following, some of which you might be surprised to know:
• We finance more than $5.5 billion in affordable housing each year (including residential and commercial lending and mortgages in low- and moderate-income communities).
• We provide small business loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
• We design products and services to promote the financial health of lower- income individuals.
• We support a number of employee- and community-based initiatives and philan- thropic activities, including:
– Office of Military and Veterans Affairs, which sponsors mentorship, devel- opment and recognition programs
to support the military and veterans working at the firm;
– Women on the Move, our global firmwide effort that empowers female employees, clients and consumers;
– The Service Corps, which mobilizes employee volunteers to help nonprofit organizations around the world;
– Advancing Black Pathways, a compre- hensive program focused on providing more opportunities for black people and black-owned businesses because we know that opportunity is not always created equally;
– Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, which is expanding and provides minority entrepreneurs with access to capital, education and other resources.
• We expect to finance more than $100 billion in transactions aimed at supporting development in emerging market coun- tries – in infrastructure, education, health- care, agribusiness and industry, among other investments – to promote the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

2 We are adjusting these CCAR results for the global market shock trading losses and operational losses — and there have been none in this crisis.
Of course, we do not know how this crisis will ultimately end, including how long it will last, how much economic damage it will do, or how fast or slow the recovery will be. We have always been serious about stress testing and run an enormous number of tests per week so that we are prepared for most crises. But as is often the case, this “actual new crisis” – while it shares attributes with what is being stress tested – is dramatically different from the expected.
We stopped buying back our stock: We have always held the position that the highest
and best use of our equity is to reinvest it in our own business and, of course, to be able to withstand tough times. Halting buybacks was simply a very prudent action – we don’t know exactly what the future will hold – but at a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008. Our bank cannot be immune to the effects of this kind of stress.
We will share in detail our latest thinking on the impact this crisis will have on our finan- cials in our first quarter earnings release in mid-April; however, to put it in context, here is how our shareholders can think broadly about a reasonable range of outcomes.
Our 2019 pretax earnings were $48 billion1
– a huge and powerful earnings stream that enables us to absorb the loss of revenues and the higher credit costs that inevitably follow a crisis. For comparison, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) results for 2020 that we submitted to the Federal Reserve in 2019 (which assumed outcomes like U.S. unemployment peaking at 10%
and the stock market falling 50%) showed a decline in revenue of almost 20% and credit costs of approximately $20 billion more than what we experienced in 2019. We believe we would perform better than this if the Fed’s scenario were to actually occur. But even in the Fed’s scenario, we would be profitable
in every quarter.2 These stress test results also show that following such a meaningful reduction in our revenue (and assuming we continue to pay dividends), our common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio would likely hold at a very strong 10%, and we would have in excess of $500 billion of liquid assets.
Additionally, we have run an extremely adverse scenario that assumes an even deeper contraction of gross domestic product, down as much as 35% in the second quarter and lasting through the end
• We are huge supporters of regional and community banks, which are critical to many cities and small towns around the country. We bank approximately 500 of America’s 5,000 regional and commu-
nity banks. In 2019, we lent or raised a total of $2.6 billion in capital for them. In addition, we provide payment-processing services for them, we finance some of their mortgage activities, we advise on acqui- sitions, and we buy and sell securities
for these banks. We also supply interest rate swaps and foreign exchange both for themselves – to help them hedge some of their exposures – and for their clients. For
example, while many community banks were seeking more liquidity to serve their local communities amidst COVID-19 fears, we were able to help approximately 100 community banks secure $775 million in increased cash availability over a three- week period in March, delivering $1.9 billion of cash to support their branches and ATMs. This is not only a win for our clients but also for the communities in which they operate.
4. We are transparent with our shareholders: What they should expect regarding our financial and operating performance in 2020.

 DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
of the year, and with U.S. unemployment continuing to increase, peaking at 14% in
the fourth quarter. Even under this scenario, the company would still end the year with strong liquidity and a CET1 ratio of approx- imately 9.5% (common equity Tier 1 capital would still total $170 billion). This scenario is quite severe and, we hope, unlikely. If it were to play out, the Board would likely consider suspending the dividend even though it is
a rather small claim on our equity capital base. If the Board suspended the dividend, it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bring.
It is also important to be aware that in both our central case scenario for 2020 results and in our extremely adverse scenario, we are lending – currently or plan to do so – an additional $150 billion for our clients’
needs. Despite this, our capital resources and liquidity are very strong in both models. We have over $500 billion in total liquid assets and an incremental $300+ billion borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks, if needed, to support these loans, as well as meet our liquidity requirements (these numbers do not include the potential use of some of the Fed’s newly created facilities). We could, of course,
make our capital and liquidity buffer better by restricting our activities, but we do not intend to do that – our clients need us.
I would like to point out that, as we get closer to the extremely adverse scenario, current regulatory constraints will limit additional actions we can take to help clients – in spite of the extraordinary amount of capital and liquidity we could deploy.
5. We are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges, we will not request any regulatory relief for ourselves.
We are just beginning to analyze and work with the government on all of their various programs. For the most part, these initiatives will need the deep involvement of the private sector to be properly executed. We intend
to do everything we can – and as soon as possible – to ensure that government support is reaching the people who need it most.
We applaud and support the recent actions the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have taken to try to miti-
gate the economic impact of the COVID-19 turmoil. The Fed’s overwhelming actions have already dramatically reduced the financial stress in the system, and there is still more they could do if they need to. For example, balance sheet expansion, additional lending facilities, and changes to capital and liquidity requirements are steps designed to ensure that more capital will flow through the system, which will ultimately allow us to help more families and small businesses. These actions would bolster the U.S. economy with
no impact on safety, soundness or regulatory oversight. We are working with the govern- ment to make sure such crisis-relief measures are structured to work effectively – there are a significant number of details that need to be resolved, which I will not go into here.
While we will aggressively help our customers take advantage of these new programs (though we must take action
to protect ourselves from ongoing – and, more important, future – litigation risk), we want our shareholders to know that we have not requested any regulatory relief for ourselves. Saying that we will not ask for regulatory relief does not mean the government shouldn’t change some rules and regulations, however. For example, some rules can improperly prevent healthy, well-capitalized banks from lending freely in times of stress. This can hurt customers as the crisis deepens. Leaving high-quality, available liquidity undeployed in times of need is an opportunity forever lost.
16

 I have written in detail in past letters that the regulatory system is in need of both reform and recalibration – not because we want it to happen but because it would be good for a deepening and widening of the financial system – something that would benefit all Americans. While a lot of the rules were constructive and made the financial system stronger, we are now seeing the impact of poorly coordinated, poorly cali- brated and poorly organized rulemaking.
6. We need a plan to get safely back to work.
It is hoped that the number of new COVID-19 cases will decrease soon and – coupled with greatly enhanced medical capabilities (more beds, proper equipment where it is needed, adequate testing) – the healthcare system is equipped to take care of all Americans, both minimizing their suffering and maximizing their chance of living. Once this occurs, people can carefully start going back to work, of course with proper social distancing, vigilant hygiene, proper testing and other precautions. There are many jobs that can be safely done; however, employees in certain companies should return to business as usual only if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other government entities deem it safe to do so.
In addition, this “return to work” process could be accelerated if federal, state and local governments make tests widely available that allow people to certify that they have contracted and recovered from the disease, have the necessary antibodies to prevent them from getting sick again and are not infectious to anyone. Initially, we need a buffer period of days or weeks for people
After the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response. And we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system. There will be a time and place for that – but not now.
to be tested, and then for those who test negative for the virus, we need to discover whether virus antibodies appear through serology testing. Both the CDC and private companies are scrambling to produce such tests: The U.K. has ordered 3.5 million
of them, Germany will use them to issue immunity certificates to COVID-19 survi- vors, and China and Singapore already are using tests to determine how extensively the virus spread in large populations in order
to measure the true infection rate. In the United States, the Food and Drug Admin- istration is allowing doctors to use these serology tests to identify recovered patients whose antibodies could treat emergency cases of the disease.
The country was not adequately prepared for this pandemic – however, we can and should be more prepared for what comes next. Done right, a disciplined transition would maxi- mize the health of Americans and minimize the time, extent and suffering caused by the economic downturn.

7. We need to come together: My fervent hope for America.
Sometimes extraordinary events in history can cause a change in the body politic. As a nation, we were clearly not equipped for this global pandemic, and the consequences have been devastating. But it is forcing us to work together, and it is improving civility and reminding us that we all live on one planet. E Pluribus Unum.
I am hoping that civility, humanity, empathy and the goal of improving America will break through.
We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country. America is still the most prosperous nation the world has ever seen. We are blessed with the natural gifts of land; all the food, water and energy we need; the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as natural borders; and wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico. And we are blessed with the extraordinary gifts from our Founding Fathers, which are still unequaled: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom
of enterprise, and the promise of equality and opportunity. These gifts have led to the most dynamic economy the world has ever seen – one that nurtures vibrant businesses large and small, exceptional universities, and a welcoming environment for innovation, science and technology. America was an idea borne on principles, not based upon histor- ical relationships and tribal politics. It has and will continue to be a beacon of hope for the world and a magnet for the world’s best and brightest.
Of course, America has always had its flaws. The current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country: Our inner city schools don’t graduate half of their students and don’t give our children an education that leads to a livelihood; our healthcare system is increasingly costly with many of our citi- zens lacking any access; and nutrition and personal health aren’t even being taught at many schools. Obesity has become a national scourge. We have a litigation and regulatory
system that cripples small businesses with red tape and bureaucracy; ineffective infra- structure planning and investment; and huge waste and inefficiency at both the state and federal levels. We have failed to put proper immigration policies in place; our social safety nets are poorly designed; and the share of wages for the bottom 30% of Americans has effectively been going down. We need to acknowledge these problems
and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them.
There should have been a pandemic play- book. Likewise, every problem I noted above should have detailed and nonpartisan solu- tions. As we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we – at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humani- tarian organizations – could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale. While the inclination of some will be to finger-point and look for blame,
I hope we can avoid that. I also hope we can avoid people using times of crisis to argue for what they already believe. We need to demand more of ourselves and our leaders if we want to prevent or mitigate these disasters. This can be a moment when we all come together and recognize our shared responsibility, acting in a way that reflects the best of all of us. As President Kennedy historically said, “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.”
My fervent hope is that America rolls up its sleeves and starts to attack these problems. Fixing them would better prepare us for future catastrophes, create better economic outcomes for everyone (with policies that aim to maximize economic growth, driving the best potential outcomes), improve income inequality, protect the most vulner- able and foster economic growth that is more resilient, which would also strengthen America’s role in the world. We must never
18

 forget that America’s economic prosperity
is a necessary foundation for our military capability, which keeps us free and strong and is essential to world peace. These issues could all be tackled while preserving the freedoms ascribed by our Founding Fathers: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of enterprise, which means the free movement of capital and labor (meaning you
can work where you want and for whom you want). At the end of the day, the pursuit of happiness, our freedoms and free enterprise are inseparable.
If we acknowledge our problems and work together, we can lift up those who need help and society as a whole. Business and govern- ment collaborating together can conquer our biggest challenges.
IN CLOSING
While I have a deep and abiding faith in the United States of America and its extraordinary resiliency and capabilities, we do not have
a divine right to success. Our challenges are significant, and we should not assume they will take care of themselves. Let us all do what
we can to strengthen our exceptional union.
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the employees of JPMorgan Chase, and I’d also like to thank all of you who shared your good wishes with me while
I was recuperating from my recent heart surgery. From this letter, I hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for
the tremendous character and capabilities of our people and how they have helped communities around the world. They have faced these times of adversity with grace and fortitude. I hope you are as proud of them as I am. Finally, the countries and citizens of the global community will get through this unprecedented situation, undoubtedly stronger for it. Together, we will rise to the challenge.

 Consumer & Community Banking
We continue to make real progress in Consumer & Community Banking, and I am proud of what our great team has accomplished. We have built multiple market-leading busi- nesses while de-risking and simplifying them, and we worked with regulators to close gaps and make tough decisions. We do the hard work each and every day to
put our customers first and do the right thing.
Our performance in 2019 is the result of that discipline and effort. We are the #1 U.S. credit card issuer based on sales and outstanding balances. We are the #1 primary bank in our footprint. We are the #1 business bank based on primary relationships. We are the #2 mortgage servicer and the #3 bank auto lender.
We take nothing for granted and remain humble and motivated as we compete to be, or stay, best in class.
2019 financial results
In 2019, Consumer & Community Banking delivered a 31% return on equity on record net income of $16.6 billion. Our $55.9 billion in revenue was up 7% year-over-year. We reduced our overhead ratio to 51.7% and self-funded significant investments. We grew our customer base to nearly 63 million U.S. house- holds, including over 4 million small businesses. This performance is a direct result of the growth in our business drivers and our sus- tained focus on investing for the medium and long term.
Our average deposits of $694 billion were up 3% over 2018, and client investment assets reached $358 bil- lion, up 27%. We ended the year with $464 billion in average loans, reflecting $43 billion in loan sales over the last two years. Our customer base of active mobile users is the
largest and, on an absolute basis, the fastest growing among U.S. banks: 37 million, up 12% year-over-year.
There was no way to predict that credit performance would remain as strong as it has over these last few years, and that has positively contrib- uted to the performance we deliv- ered in 2019.
We achieved our 2019 results with continued focus on six strategic prior- ities that have remained consistent and have proved to be effective. We bring in new customers, drive engage- ment across multiple channels and always focus on improving their expe- rience with us. We closely manage expenses and simplify our business, and we seek efficiency and greater productivity. We’re intensely focused on the regulatory and risk and control environment. We work to hire the best, diverse talent in the industry that also reflects the diverse commu- nities we serve.
Here are some highlights of what we accomplished in 2019 in each of these areas:
Acquire, deepen and retain customer relationships by offering compelling value propositions
We’re bringing in new customers and earning more of their valuable business. In 2019, we grew the total number of households we serve and increased the number of households that have a relationship with more than one Chase line of business even faster than households overall. Among our consumer households, 25% have a relationship with two or more Chase lines of business.
Our lending businesses – Credit Card, Home Lending and Auto – are a significant acquisition funnel for our deepest customer relationships,

  NEW TOOLS FOR CUSTOMERS
We’ve started to bring together our digital experiences to engage customers at an earlier stage in their financial journey. Doing so can help them reach their goals faster. Our already- established digital tools give customers a clear view and understanding of their finances.
Today, customers can better understand and manage some of their most important financial
assets; for example, their home. In 2019, we rolled out a digital mortgage offering, Chase MyHome, allowing customers to apply for a loan and initiate a mortgage origination digitally.
Customers can use features such as Credit Jour- ney to receive a detailed view of their finances and borrowing ability; Autosave allows them to set a down payment savings goal. And with Chase MyHome, they can review the value of
their current home and explore their neighbor- hood before applying for a new loan.
These are just a few examples of how we con- tinue to do more to help our customers with their everyday finances. We plan to create more of these experiences for customers with similar opportunities, such as buying a car, saving for a vacation and staying on top of everyday purchases.
    Credit Journey
Customers visit Credit Journey to understand their borrowing ability.
Approximately 22 million customers enrolled in Credit Journey as of December 2019.
Autosave
Customers can set goals to save for major purchases.
Autosave helped our customers save more than $1.5 billion in 2019.
Chase MyHome
Users can get home value information on Chase MyHome and track prog- ress through a simplified mortgage experience.
More than 1 million customers have visited Chase MyHome since April 2019, and about 80%1 of customers used Chase MyHome in 4Q19.

 bringing in more than half of all new-to-Chase households. Our lend- ing customers respond to Consumer Banking marketing at three times the rate of pure prospects; in branch expansion markets, the response rate is even better. Customers with these deeper relationships are more satis- fied and less likely to leave Chase. We continually improve and sim- plify the customer experience and offer new, customer-centered digital capabilities using our data to benefit and protect our customers.
In Consumer & Business Banking, our focus is to be our customers’ primary bank. Customers consider a wide range of factors when choosing their primary bank. Over 75% of our checking households are primary
relationships, and we are the #1 business bank based on primary bank relationships. The deposits these customers bring to us are the outcome of that relationship.
Drive engagement through omnichannel, customer-centered experiences
The scale of our distribution gives us a competitive advantage. When we bring new products and services to the marketplace, we bring them to nearly 63 million households that engage with us on a regular basis. On any given day in 2019, 28 million customers visited us, called us or logged in to our digital channels. Two-thirds of our Consumer Bank- ing customers used more than one
channel to interact with us during the year. We are still committed to our omnichannel strategy because our customers are. And all of our channels have evolved based upon our customers’ preferences and expectations. For example, we’re able to build branches in new markets farther apart than branches in our legacy markets because of our new tools and capabilities: our digital account opening functional- ity and data about our existing customers in those markets.
In these newer markets, customers can choose whether to open an account in a branch or digitally. Until 2018, our checking and sav- ings accounts could only be opened

These efforts have made us better at providing the capabilities and fea- tures that improve the customer experience. As an example, we began extending already-approved offers
to existing customers for whom we had enough information to make
an approval decision. Being able to show customers products they are qualified for is a superior client experience. Previously, these same customers had been required to reap- ply for products using the same application as a new-to-Chase customer. For certain customers –
10 million to date – that wasn’t nec- essary; we wanted to save their time and make it easier to do more busi- ness with us. Customers value the transparency and certainty of these already-approved offers and the sim- ple one-click experience to accept them. Personalized offers such as these convert at rates up to 20% higher than our traditional market- ing offers.
Manage expenses and simplify our business while continuing to invest for the future
We closely manage expenses, con- tinuously simplifying and investing for the medium and long term – driving down our overhead ratio in the process. Our 2019 overhead ratio of 51.7% was 170 basis points better than in 2018 and 6 percentage points better than five years ago. In areas where we have become more efficient, we have been able to self- fund some of our investments in our businesses.
Many of the investments we made have allowed us to reduce annual expenses via automation and enabled the improved productivity described earlier. In Consumer Banking, our investments in digital self-service capabilities have reduced
         in a branch. In addition, we were able to use the information we have about where our customers live, work and shop to determine the optimal locations to place our new branches and ATMs. This has allowed us to enter markets with the smartest possible footprint and helps explain why the early-stage performance of these branches has exceeded our expectations.
In our digital channels, we are pro- viding new features for our custom- ers based on their relationship with Chase. In Chase Mobile, our Snap- shot feature offers personalized insights to help customers make the most of their money. One insight that educates customers on how to begin saving automatically – Auto- save – enabled our customers to set aside more than $1.5 billion in 2019.
Improve productivity, agility and customer experience through data, analytics and technology
We’re using data, analytics and tech- nology to improve the customer experience and drive productivity. Over the last five years, our opera- tional staff has become 20% more productive, serving a larger cus- tomer base with a smaller team.
The cost to serve each household has declined 14% over the same time period, as the share of transac- tions completed through self-service channels has grown more than
10 percentage points.
We are adopting more agile ways of working, including a product- and platform-based architecture. Product and platform owners have end-to- end ownership, which puts decision making closer to the customer, help- ing us move faster than we could in an annual planning cycle.
26

 everyday branch transactions per customer by 49% since 2014 – eliminating transactions that are simple and easy for customers to manage anywhere and at their con- venience, such as depositing checks.
Our investments for the long term have also led to revenue growth. Examples include the 400 branches we are in the process of opening in new markets to extend our reach. Our new branches in existing mar- kets break even seven months faster than they did five years ago, and the branches in our newer markets are trending even better than that.
Operate a disciplined risk and control environment, protect the firm’s systems, and safeguard customer and employee privacy
As always, we are focused on manag- ing risk appropriately and using well-designed controls. This work is never done. Investing in these efforts remains our highest priority, and we have done so consistently over time. We are vigilant and never compla- cent in this space.
Over the last five years, for example, we’ve used technology and machine learning to reduce fraud losses in the credit card business by 50%.
We have made great strides to pro- tect customer data, as well as our own systems, when sharing data. Previously, to share information with approved third parties, customers provided their Chase login creden- tials, giving access to their entire Chase profile. This enabled third parties to obtain information beyond the scope of the customer’s inten- tion. That wasn’t safe for the cus- tomer or for us. Now we require these third parties to abide by our data-sharing rules, and we securely
send data that customers choose for us to provide on their behalf. This reduces risk for all parties while giving transparency and control to our customers.
Attract, develop and retain the best talent for today and the future, harnessing the power of diversity
Our talent sets us apart, and we work to attract and retain the best, diverse talent for today and tomor- row. Our team must represent and reflect the diverse customers we serve every day. We are proud that more than 57% of our employees in Consumer & Community Banking are female and more than half of our U.S. employees identify as a minor- ity. The roles with the highest minority representation are dispro- portionately our customer-facing, front-line roles rather than executive management. We are mindful of this imbalance and are working tirelessly to correct it.
Representation is only part of the equation when it comes to attracting and retaining world-class talent. We are focused on driving inclusiveness and reinforcing the fact that we all are responsible for keeping a culture where everyone is respected and valued for who they are and what they contribute.
Conclusion
We have built tremendous busi- nesses that deliver repeatable reve- nue. Each year, we work hard to bring in new customers, retain exist- ing ones and generate earnings throughout economic cycles. We are experiencing turbulent times across the country – and the world – as we get set to publish this letter. We are here for our customers in good times and tough times, and that is true now more than ever.
Over the last few weeks, we have been offering relief to our customers and small business clients who are struggling financially. We have pro- vided payment relief for credit cards, auto loans and home loans. We also continue to lend money.
And as we forge ahead through this challenging time and get through it, we still see opportunities to help and support more people. Two opportunities that stand out are: helping a broader range of Ameri- cans manage their financial lives and earning the chance to manage investments for the many millions of households that work with Chase as their primary bank.
Our Chase franchise is powerful and differentiated from our peers. We will continue to support our customers, small business clients, communities and employees now and in the future.

 Corporate & Investment Bank
In 2019, the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) generated earnings of $11.9 billion on revenue of $38.3 bil- lion – a record year for our business.
This standout performance is the cul- mination of a journey that began during the 2008 financial crisis when clients turned to J.P. Morgan for capi- tal, liquidity and a safe haven.
In 2009, 10 years ago, client business drove earnings in our investment bank to a record $6.9 billion. By 2019, the CIB’s earnings had topped the entire firm’s net income from 2009. As we close out the decade, it is worth reflecting on the strategy that brought us to this point, helping us to gener- ate record revenue and profits and a consistently strong return on equity (ROE) while adding $42 billion to the CIB’s capital base and investing sub- stantially in the business.
Global, complete and at scale
The success of our business over the last decade has hinged chiefly on our steadfast pursuit of three strategic goals: being global, complete and at scale. The benefits of these qualities may seem obvious today but weren’t quite so clear a decade ago.
Strong Returns on Higher Capital
New regulations that followed the financial crisis helped make the banking system safer overall but also made investment banking more expensive. Banks had to hold a lot more capital, which reduced leverage and ROE. At the same time, major investments were needed in technol- ogy and compliance.
This created a predicament for banks emerging from the crisis, and they chose several different paths. Some decided to cut back on businesses that were less profitable or carried too much capital. Others retreated from traditional investment banking businesses altogether.
At J.P. Morgan, we believed that cli- ents would always need an array of global banking products even though margins on these products varied. We looked at our client relationships holistically and prioritized long-term value for them over short-term profitability for us. That decision –
to continue to provide a full suite of products and services for clients across the globe – has proved to be mutually beneficial.
Having scale has been equally criti- cal to our success. Following the financial crisis, we believed that clients would gravitate to the best ideas and offerings, particularly if they could be accessed anywhere and at any time.
Over the years, that scale has become a springboard for growth. In 2010, we began to expand our interna- tional corporate banking effort to include multinational clients around the globe, with 100 bankers dedi- cated to serving 2,200 clients. Today, our 400 corporate bankers cover 3,300 companies and their subsidiar- ies worldwide. In addition, we are partnering with Commercial Bank- ing to extend our services to middle market clients internationally.
Commitment and consistency
Supporting clients during periods of crisis has always been a hallmark of our business. A decade ago, when investors were worried about bank exposures in struggling economies such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, we did not retrench. On the contrary: In 2009 and 2010, we stood by those countries, raising

Wholesale Payments celebrated its first year as a combined business that brought together the services we offer to corporate treasurers with those for global merchants. The busi- ness performed well during a year in which the Federal Reserve cut inter- est rates multiple times and margins on deposits tightened.
Wholesale Payments supports clients across the bank; within the CIB alone, Treasury Services revenue was up 39% since 2015. Cash management and clearing were among the strong revenue generators in 2019. In addi- tion, the acquisition of Philadelphia- based InstaMed, an innovative health- care payments company, was the firm’s largest since the financial crisis.
Ongoing investments in the busi- ness, which processed $43 million in payments per second last year across more than 120 currencies, helped drive organic growth and a healthy pipeline. In basic terms, Wholesale Payments enables clients to make, manage and accept payments securely anytime, anywhere and by any method. Our opportunity here is tremendous, particularly as business gravitates to larger banks with global scale.

We have also tightened restrictions on certain activities, such as financing for coal mining and Arctic drilling, and are on track to meet our own commit- ment from three years ago to source renewable energy for our entire 2020 global power needs. These initiatives are enthusiastically supported by
our employees, as well as by the next generation of recruits, who want
J.P. Morgan to lead in this space.
That said, business alone cannot ensure the transition to a lower- carbon economy. Government policy is crucial. Recently, we joined the Climate Leadership Council, a group promoting a bipartisan road map for a revenue-neutral, carbon tax-and- dividend framework for the U.S.
Conclusion
Our impressive 2019 performance was not easily won, as competition and geopolitical uncertainty intensi- fied. The year 2020, however, has already presented all of us with our most challenging problem yet: a pandemic of proportions not seen for 100 years.
Across the firm, taking care of our employees and standing by our clients during events like the corona- virus are critical priorities. With so many companies, institutions and governments relying on J.P. Morgan for their own operations and eco- nomic well-being, it’s essential that we do the right things day to day, staying focused on risk, costs and making sure our clients have access to the capital they need. We must also think about optimizing the business for the near future, continuously mak- ing adjustments to ensure that we are as efficient and effective as possible while closing addressable gaps.
Finally, we must think creatively about next-generation transforma- tion and ways that our businesses will change over the next five to 10 years. To that end, we are evaluating emerging technologies and reshap- ing our approach to data to bring the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to all our busi- nesses. We’re also building out our infrastructure to reduce friction, improve client service and offer access to sophisticated analytics.
We have the most solid underpin- nings for the enduring success of a world-class business: the capital, the brainpower and the hard-earned experience to get things right. Although we will be tested by any number and variety of uncertainties in the years to come, these qualities make me confident and optimistic about our shared future.

At J.P. Morgan, a readiness to adapt has always characterized the way we do business, and our approach to environmental, social and gover- nance issues is no different. The issue of environmental sustainabil- ity is gaining urgency by the day and is among the growing risks being evaluated by our business
and policymakers.
We understand the pressing nature of climate change and believe that companies like ours can add tremen- dous value by helping global compa- nies – and the global economy – transition to cleaner energy.
Currently, around 80% of the world’s energy is sourced from fossil fuels, which remain the primary source for heating homes and powering cars. We are working to reduce this dependency by committing billions of dollars to sustainable projects in 2020 alone, including green technol- ogies. Furthermore, we are embed- ding sustainability into many of our daily business practices, from assess- ing risk to designing products to advising clients.

 Commercial Banking
Across JPMorgan Chase, we measure our success not just by our financial results, but by our ability to make a positive difference for our clients, employees, communities and share- holders. Over the last several years in Commercial Banking (CB), we’ve been executing a consistent, long-term strategy focused on doing just that.
Our shareholders: Investing for long-term value
Strong 2019 financial performance
To create value in CB, we work hard every day to add great clients and deepen those relationships over time. We’ve been making sustained invest- ments in our people and capabilities to drive results across our business. In the last two years, we’ve hired more than 300 bankers and expanded our presence to 24 high- potential locations. These invest- ments have led to more client activ- ity than ever before, and in 2019, we added over 1,700 new client relation- ships, a 60% increase since 2017.
MAINTAINING STRONG PERFORMANCE
Middle Market Expansion Revenue
Our intense client focus and disci- plined execution have resulted in consistent strong financial perfor- mance across our business. In 2019, CB generated $9.0 billion in reve- nue, $3.9 billion in net income and a return on equity of 17%. While our overall results were affected by lower interest rates, the fundamen- tals of our business remained out- standing, with record Treasury Services fee revenue of $1.5 billion and steady loan and deposit growth. We continued to benefit from our strong partnership with the Corpo- rate & Investment Bank, delivering record investment banking revenue of $2.7 billion, up 10% from 2018.
Our credit discipline has served us well, and by maintaining our strict underwriting standards, our net charge-off rate in 2019 was 8 basis points. This marked the eighth straight year in which net charge-offs were less than 10 basis points.
Enormous growth potential
The overall potential to expand our business is tremendous, and as we enter into a new decade, we remain focused on our multifaceted long-term growth strategy. Our Middle Market expansion effort is a terrific example of identifying a market opportunity and executing with purpose. Since 2008, we’ve nearly doubled our foot- print across the country, moving into 47 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), adding locations in over 20 states and hiring almost 500 bankers. We’ve been able to compete and suc- ceed in these new markets because of the quality of our team, the strength of our brand and JPMorgan Chase’s unmatched capabilities, delivered at
a very local level. To date, we’ve selec- tively added almost 3,300 clients, over $15 billion of loans and over
$13 billion of deposits.
We’re equally excited about expand- ing our business internationally. In 2019, we hired nearly 80 bankers to serve non-U.S.-headquartered, multi-

  MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES
We take great pride in the work we do to support our communities. We ended 2019 with over $54 billion in financing to local companies, states and municipalities, schools, nonprofits and healthcare providers. We also originated over $2 billion in loans for the construction of affordable housing for low- income individuals. In addition, our teams are very active civically and volunteered more than 25,000 hours with local organizations.
national companies across 18 coun- tries. We have a significant opportu- nity to support these clients not only in the U.S. but also in other key geographies around the world. As CB continues to build internation- ally, we benefit greatly from the firm’s existing local knowledge and well-established risk, compliance and control infrastructure. Similar to our strategy in the U.S., we are taking a long-term view, focused on selecting only the best clients, and will continue to execute with patience and discipline.
Our clients: Relentlessly focused on delivering solutions and capital to drive their success
Clients are at the absolute center of everything we do, and every day, we strive to deliver differentiated advice, tailored solutions and meaningful capital to help them succeed. The breadth and quality of our capabili- ties, along with our outstanding team, allow us to build deep, valuable relationships over time. By being part of JPMorgan Chase, we have the ability to serve clients throughout the life cycle of their businesses – from opening their first operating accounts and expanding overseas to
funding an important acquisition or taking their company public. In 2019, across our business, we made more than 290,000 client calls and grew loans by $2.4 billion, ending the
year with $208 billion in average loan balances. Our long-term view, unmatched solutions and enduring commitment to our clients set us apart in the industry.
As our clients’ expectations continue to evolve, we have dedicated teams designing new functionality that
will deliver even greater value to our clients and enhance their experience. This design-led approach has informed our investments in technology, data, digital and payments. To date, our work has resulted in tangible bene- fits, such as faster credit delivery, reduced account opening time and new integrated solutions.
We can uniquely bring our clients an entire suite of wholly owned, global treasury capabilities, includ- ing merchant acquiring, commercial cards and cross-border payments. These integrated solutions allow clients to accept any method of payment, in any currency, around the world. Moreover, clients can connect with us however they want,
from a global exchange to applica- tion programming interfaces. As a result of the investments we are making in our comprehensive pay- ments platform, we can deliver valu- able analytics and insights to clients across all of their treasury activities to optimize their businesses.
Our communities: Serving as a positive force where we live and work
In CB, we embrace our obligation to be a positive force in our communi- ties. We ended 2019 with over $54 billion in financing to local compa- nies, states and municipalities, schools, nonprofits and healthcare providers. We have dedicated teams across the country, working hard to support these vital institutions so they can continue to keep our com- munities strong.
Our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) businesses are also at the forefront of this important work. As the #1
1 multifamily lender in the U.S. ,
Commercial Term Lending (CTL) provides capital to apartment build- ing and workforce housing owners. In 2019, more than 40% of the loans originated in CTL funded properties in low- to moderate-income neighbor-

CEO, Commercial Banking

            Asset & Wealth Management
2019 marked my 10th year as CEO of Asset & Wealth Management. During this past decade, we have success- fully helped millions of individuals and institutions around the world invest for their futures. Our clients come to us for advice, ideas and solu- tions for some of their most impor- tant life events, and for help in navi- gating through turbulent times. We cherish our clients’ trust and never take it for granted.
Strong investment performance for clients
Our success begins with a focus on investment performance, which requires the unwavering, long-term prioritization and retention of our 1,000+ investment professionals. This has led to 88% of 10-year long-term mutual fund assets under management above peer median and 196 mutual funds 4- or 5-star
1
rated . It’s worth noting that our per-
formance is not concentrated in any asset class or region. It represents leading performance across all asset classes globally.
We strive to be the best, not the biggest. If you relentlessly work to be the best, you will have years like 2019, in which we received $194 billion in net new client asset flows2. In fact, since 2015, we received half a trillion dollars in net new client asset flows2. Similar to our investment performance, our flows are not concentrated in any one asset class, region or client segment, but come from a well- diversified set of businesses.
Strong financial performance for shareholders
I am proud of our results for our clients, while, at the same time, we continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders. In 2019, Asset & Wealth Manage- ment achieved record total client assets of $3.2 trillion, record revenue of $14.3 billion, record pretax income of $3.7 billion and return on equity of 26%. Our reliable and consistent growth has been powered by success across our diversified Asset Management (AM) and Wealth Management (WM) franchises.

Asset Management
Since 2009, AM grew revenue2 by 1.5x to $7.3 billion and pretax income by 1.4x to $1.9 billion. That success has been driven by a broad, diversified platform. On long-term AUM, we achieved record levels across asset classes (Equity, Fixed Income, Multi-Asset), segments (Retail and Institutional) and geogra- phies (U.S. and International). We also achieved success in key growth areas of the market, with Multi-Asset AUM growing by 6.4x to $267 billion and, in particular, Target Date AUS growing by 25x to $125 billion.
Wealth Management
Growth since 2009 is an equally powerful story in WM, where revenue grew by 1.8x to a record $7.1 billion and pretax income by 1.7x to $1.9 bil- lion. We continue to differentiate our- selves by providing the advice, solu- tions and client experience that our clients need. As an example of their commitment, we’ve nearly tripled
the number of clients with over $100 million of total positions to a record

level. In addition, we’ve grown the number of managed accounts by 7.6x to a record 730,000.
Growth priorities for the next decade
Looking ahead to the next decade, we are highlighting five major drivers to continue our momentum:
• Focusing on U.S. Wealth Management: This is one of the firm’s biggest opportunities with the U.S. repre- senting approximately $50 trillion

in market size . For example,
•
internationally, where we have less than 2% market share3. We plan to capture share by continuing to be the go-to bank, delivering solutions across the balance sheet.
Scaling Asset Management: To scale, we need strong, diversified long- term investment performance, which we have with 91% of Equity, 81% of Fixed Income and 90% of Multi-Asset Solutions & Alternatives 10-year mutual fund AUM above peer median. This performance has driven our above-industry growth over the last 10 years4 and will con- tinue to be our foundation to scale over the next 10 years. And with around 2% market share across asset classes4, we have significant opportunity to capture share.
Chase banks half of the 22 million households within the $1 million to $10 million net worth segment , but only 5% have investments with us. We have a tremendous opportunity to capture new clients and deepen current relationships.
• Expanding the Global Private Bank: Over the last five years, we’ve hired approximately 1,300 advi- sors, successfully converted hundreds of referrals from around the firm, attracted over 11,000 net new clients and captured around $200 billion in client asset flows. We still have a significant expan- sion opportunity, particularly

• Building Alternatives: We are cele- brating our 50th anniversary of managing what is now nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars in Alter- native assets. I am excited about the opportunities to continue build- ing our franchise, from expanding our leading core real estate capabil- ities to building out our newly con- solidated private credit capabilities.

• Considering M&A: While we always prefer organic growth, there are times when the industry changes drastically, and we need to be on top of it, which is what we are doing now. We are very selective, evaluating every M&A opportunity for an adjacent capability. But most important, we always prioritize our clients’ needs and increasing share- holder value.
Continuing to invest in the business
Our long-term commitment means that we will continue to serve our clients and invest in making our business better for the future:
• Front office: We will continue to hire top front office talent. Addi- tionally, we will continue to invest in our investment capabilities, spending around $320 million on AM research and making thou- sands of company visits annually.
• Technology: We are creating and leveraging tools, such as You Invest and machine learning, to help our clients and employees focus on higher-value activities and make better decisions. We always look to simplify our production processes so that 50+% of our technology spend is dedicated to new and excit- ing capabilities that deliver stronger client outcomes.
• Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG): With the help of industry experts we have hired, we are doing more than ever before, focusing on our clients’ needs and delivering across AM and WM. In AM, we are working toward 100% of AUM being ESG- integrated while we launch new ESG-focused WM strategies.
• China:We’vebeeninChinasincethe 1970s, and we are set to become the first foreign asset manager to fully own a Chinese fund manager with China International Fund Manage- ment. Our increased stake will fur- ther solidify our position in China and better address our clients’ needs.
As I write this letter, we are at an unprecedented moment in time.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused many people to suffer, created historic volatility and changed how we work and live. However, we can take comfort in knowing that people around the world are coming together to respond to these challenges in powerful and inspiring ways.
As a fiduciary, we view events that completely disrupt an industry, coun- try or way of living as the times when active security selection (and deselection) is of the utmost impor- tance. With all three of these areas
being impacted concurrently in 2020, now is the most important time to have portfolios actively managed.
In times like these, I’m also reminded of how fortunate I am to be part of JPMorgan Chase. For more than 200 years, we have been at our best in the most difficult of times. I am proud of, and inspired by, how our colleagues and partners have responded to this crisis, and I remain incredibly opti- mistic about the firm’s future.

 Corporate Responsibility
As the world faces the health and eco- nomic consequences of COVID-19, the challenges ahead are a stark reminder that too many people already struggle with economic insecurity every day. This struggle will likely escalate as this public health crisis continues to disrupt the global economy.
Now more than ever, business must step up and collaborate with local, civic and government leaders to lend our expertise toward solutions that support our customers, communities and employees in need. Business Roundtable’s recent Statement
on the Purpose of a Corporation made clear that America’s largest companies must operate for the benefit of all stakeholders, and we must be there for them in both good and challenging times.
For JPMorgan Chase, this means bringing the full force of our business to lift up those we serve around the world, focused on where we can deliver the greatest impact and reinvigorate the global economy to benefit more people.
In response to COVID-19 and in addi- tion to efforts across the firm to sup- port our customers and employees in need, we made an initial $50 million philanthropic commitment to help those most affected by humanitarian challenges, as well as sustainable and innovative solutions to help small businesses and underserved commu- nities recover when the crisis subsides. We will continue to focus on areas where we can leverage our core busi- ness, philanthropy and policy exper- tise to help the most vulnerable in the short and long term. In addition to supporting small businesses, this approach has effectively informed and scaled solutions across pillars that will remain critical to helping
those most vulnerable as they face financial hardship and uncertain work opportunities, including neigh- borhood development, financial health, and jobs and skills.
Our ongoing efforts to help prepare workers for the future of work exemplify this strategy in practice. As technology alters nearly every facet of work, the education and skills that people need are rapidly changing. We have combined our resources and reach to give people the education and skills they need to succeed. We have committed $350 million globally to support and scale the most effective local initiatives to equip people with in-demand skills. This investment will be even more critical given the recent unforeseen disruption in the global economy and the longer-term need to rebuild the labor market. From Delhi to Detroit, efforts focused on opportunity and inclusivity, like career and technical education in high schools to appren- ticeships in growing industries, are preparing more people to launch successful careers. Additionally, in partnership with our Human Resources team, we’re redefining how we train and develop our employees by identifying future- critical skills.
Scaling the most effective programs and creating greater economic oppor- tunity for the most vulnerable will require thoughtful and effective pub- lic policy. Last year, we launched the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter to advance policies at the federal, state and local levels that strengthen com- munities and change lives.
Business leadership in developing policy solutions is critical as we work to address the longer-term impact of this crisis. We have a track record
of supporting policies that provide
economic opportunity to more people, including by giving those who have a criminal history a second chance. We are advocating at the state and federal levels for reforms including “banning the box,” establishing automatic record expungement for certain offenses and promoting fair-chance hiring
in the financial services sector. In 2019, our firm gave second chances to 3,000 people in the U.S. with criminal backgrounds.
As the world responds to this health and economic crisis, we will need to be nimble and lean into our strengths to best support those who have been most vulnerable to economic disrup- tion. We will continue to apply what we learn to scale solutions, deepen our impact and support our custom- ers, communities and colleagues. Make no mistake: An inclusive economy is a stronger economy,
and we all have an interest in that.

  Creating an economy that works for more people
Companies like ours have a responsibility to step up and help solve pressing challenges. When communities do well, our firm does well. This conviction is reflected in how JPMorgan Chase does business every day. We’re investing in our customers, employees and communities around the world to break down barriers to opportunity and create an economy that works for more people.
We are combining our business and policy expertise, sustainable business practices, data, capital and global presence to advance solu- tions worldwide. Our efforts focus on five key areas where we believe we can make the greatest impact: jobs and skills, neighborhood development, small business expansion, financial health and sustainability.
Advancing policy solutions
Public policy is a critical tool to scale the most innovative and impactful approaches that bring about lasting change. In 2019, we launched the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter to develop and advance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions that drive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the world.
Through the PolicyCenter, we are advancing pol- icy changes to remove barriers to employment for people with a criminal background and advocating for policy solutions that will enable more young people — particularly those who lack opportunity — to access high-quality career- readiness programs that pave the way to well- paying jobs. In 2020, the PolicyCenter will expand its focus to tackle additional issue areas.
Harnessing the power of data
Sound public policy is informed by timely, granular data. The JPMorgan Chase Institute is dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Leveraging the firm’s unique assets and proprietary data, the Institute helps policymakers, businesses and nonprofit leaders use timely data and thoughtful analyses to address critical issues and advance global prosperity.
Our data allow us to better understand and answer important questions about the finan- cial health and resilience of U.S. consumers, businesses and communities, as well as study labor and financial markets. In 2019, the Institute shared valuable insights across a range of areas, including how student loan
payments affect the financial lives of 4.6 million families; how Miami’s small businesses turn a profit yet have limited cash buffers; and how families are weathering financial volatility on a monthly basis.
Preparing workers for the future of work
Technological change continues to transform the world of work. By 2030, more than 30% of American workers and 375 million workers globally will need to change jobs or upgrade their skills significantly in order to advance within the workforce. We are investing $350 mil- lion over the next five years to equip young people and adults with the skills they need to be successful in a rapidly changing economy. We are working to create greater economic mobility and career pathways for workers both inside our firm and in our communities. Our firm is investing in our employees through long-term training and reskilling efforts. We are also making long-term commitments to boost career readiness. We invested $7 million in Denver, Colorado’s youth apprenticeship system to develop strong connections between high schools and higher education, focused on well- paying careers in the region’s growing industries.
Boosting small business growth
Through our long-term investments around the world, we have seen firsthand how underserved, minority entrepreneurs have the power to lift up entire communities. Yet these populations often face unique barriers that inhibit their suc- cess. This is why our efforts focus on unleashing their power as drivers of opportunity. We have taken many insights learned from innovative models, such as the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF), and are applying them to more communities. For example, in Paris, we’re working with nonprofit partners to help local and diverse entrepreneurs in Seine-Saint-Denis grow their businesses. In London, we’re giving a boost to female entrepreneurs by providing technical support and hands-on mentorship.
Cultivating thriving neighborhoods
Housing that individuals and families can afford, in proximity to economic opportunity and basic services, is the cornerstone of vibrant and resilient neighborhoods. Producing, pre- serving and protecting affordable housing is essential to our strategy for creating thriving neighborhoods. For example, we’re investing $22 million to develop and preserve affordable housing in San Francisco and Oakland. This investment, which combines long-term, low-cost loans and philanthropic capital, will provide more affordable housing and protect local residents from being displaced.
Advancing financial health
Sound financial health is the foundation on which strong and resilient households, com- munities and economies are built. We’re using our data, expertise and capital to improve the financial health of customers, employees and communities. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase made a $25 million commitment to the Financial Solutions Lab, which supports technology- based innovations that improve financial health. This investment builds on our five-year collaboration with the Financial Solutions Lab, which has supported nearly 40 innovative financial technology companies (fintechs) that have raised over $500 million in capital since joining the program, saving U.S. residents more than $1 billion.
Transitioning to a low-carbon economy
JPMorgan Chase is committed to creating a more sustainable future for our employees, customers and communities. Our firm has committed to facilitate $200 billion in financing in 2020 to support the objectives of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, with a focus on addressing climate change and advancing social and economic development.
We are also promoting bipartisan, market- based policy solutions — such as a carbon tax-and-dividend framework for the U.S. — to reduce carbon emissions and protect consumers. And we’ve expanded restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power and prohibited financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic. Finally, we’re on track to source renewable energy for 100% of our own global power needs by the end of 2020.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This executive overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and does not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this 2019 Form 10-K. For a complete description of the trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business (“LOBs”), this 2019 Form 10-K should be read in its entirety.
Financial performance of JPMorgan Chase
• Noninterest expense was $65.5 billion, up 3%, driven by continued investments across the businesses including employees, technology, real estate, and marketing, as well as higher volume- and revenue-related expenses, including depreciation expense on auto lease assets, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.
• Income tax expense included $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits.
• The provision for credit losses was $5.6 billion, up $714 million, reflecting increases in both wholesale and consumer. The increase in the wholesale provision reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select client downgrades. The prior year reflected a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher recoveries. The increase in the consumer provision reflects higher net charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses in Card, predominantly offset by a higher reduction in the allowance for loan losses in Home Lending. The prior year also benefited from larger recoveries in Home Lending on loan sales.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $14.3 billion at December 31, 2019, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.39%, flat compared with the prior year; excluding the PCI portfolio, the equivalent ratio was 1.31% compared with 1.23% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $4.5 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease from $5.2 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting paydowns in the wholesale portfolio and improved credit performance in the consumer portfolio.
• Firmwide average total loans of $955 billion were up 1%, or up 3% excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending.
Selected capital-related metrics
• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $188 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.4% and 13.4%, respectively.
• The Firm’s SLR was 6.3%.
• The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending 2019 at $60.98, up 8%.
ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 57–59, and Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 for a further discussion of each of these measures.

• Net income was $36.4 billion, up 12%.

Net interest income was $57.2 billion, up 4%, driven by continued balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.

Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 141, and the Risk Factors section on pages 6–28 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2020 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory, and legal environments in which it operates.
Firmwide full-year 2020
• Management expects full-year 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $57 billion, market dependent, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates offset by balance sheet growth and mix.
• The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, while investing for growth and innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to be approximately $67 billion.
• The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at very low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects full-year 2020 net charge-offs to be just over $6 billion, an increase from prior year, driven by Card on growth and mix.
• Management expects the full-year 2020 effective tax rate, on a reported basis, to be approximately 20%, and approximately 5 to 7 percentage points higher on a managed basis.
First-quarter 2020
• Management expects first-quarter 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $14.2 billion, market dependent.
• Firmwide adjusted expense for the first-quarter 2020 is expected to be approximately $17 billion.
• The effective tax rate, on a reported basis, for the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be approximately 17% largely as a result of tax benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards.
• Markets revenue for the first-quarter of 2020 is expected to be higher when compared with the prior-year quarter by mid-teens percentage points, depending on market conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis Business Developments
Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” occurred on January 31, 2020.
Following this departure, the U.K. has entered a transition period that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. The purpose of the transition period is to enable the U.K. and the EU to negotiate the terms of their future relationship. The transition period can be extended, but both sides need to agree to extend it by July 1, 2020. It is not clear whether the terms of the future relationship can be agreed before the end of 2020, and so significant uncertainty remains about the relationship between the U.K. and the EU after the end of the transition period.
The Firm has a long-standing presence in the U.K., which currently serves as the regional headquarters of the Firm’s operations in over 30 countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). In the region, the Firm serves clients and customers across its business segments. The Firm has approximately 17,000 employees in the U.K., of which approximately two-thirds are in London, with operational and technology support centers in locations such as Bournemouth, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
In light of the ongoing uncertainty, the Firm continues to execute the relevant elements of its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program with the objective of being able to continue delivering the Firm’s capabilities to its EU clients. The program covers strategic implementation across all impacted businesses and functions and includes an ongoing assessment of implementation risks including political, legal and regulatory risks and plans for addressing and mitigating those risks under any scenario, including where the U.K. and the EU fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship by the end of 2020 and the transition period is not extended.
The principal operational risks associated with Brexit continue to be the potential for disruption caused by insufficient preparations by individual market participants or in the overall market ecosystem, and risks related to potential disruptions of connectivity among market participants. There continues to be regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to various matters including contract continuity, access by market participants to liquidity in certain products, such as products subject to potentially conflicting U.K. and EU regulatory requirements in relation to eligible trading venues, including certain cross-border derivative contracts and equities that are listed on both U.K. and EU exchanges, as well as ongoing access to central banks. It is uncertain as to whether any of these issues will be resolved in the negotiations, or whether any of the previous temporary solutions will be available at the end of the transition period to mitigate these risks.
The Firm is focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and operational readiness. Following are the significant updates.
Regulatory and legal entity readiness
The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are now prepared and licensed to provide services to the Firm’s EU clients, including a branch network covering locations such as Paris, Madrid and Milan.
Client readiness
The agreements covering a significant proportion of the Firm’s EU client activity have been re-documented to other EU legal entities to help facilitate continuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with clients that have not completed re-documentation to ensure preparedness both in terms of documentation and any operational changes that may be required. The Firm may be negatively impacted by any operational disruption stemming from delays of or lapses in the readiness of other market participants or market infrastructures.
Business and operational readiness
The Firm relocated certain employees during 2019 and added specific employees to certain EU legal entities, where appropriate, to support the level of client activity that has been migrated. The Firm’s longer term staffing plan will develop in accordance with the increasing level of activity in the EU entities and alongside the future legal and regulatory framework between the U.K. and EU. The Firm continues to closely monitor legislative developments, and its implementation plan allows for flexibility given the continued uncertainties.

IBOR transition
As a result of the expected discontinuation of certain unsecured benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”) regulators and market participants in various jurisdictions have been working to identify alternative reference rates that are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), a group of market and official sector participants, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its recommended alternative benchmark rate. Other alternative reference rates have been recommended in other jurisdictions. Industry sources estimate that IBORs are referenced in approximately $400 trillion of wholesale and consumer transactions globally spanning a broad range of financial products and contracts. The Firm has a significant number of IBOR-referenced contracts, including derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances.
To manage the risks associated with the transition from IBORs, JPMorgan Chase established a Firmwide LIBOR Transition program in early 2018 that is overseen by the Firmwide CFO and the CEO of the CIB. When assessing risks associated with IBOR transition, the program monitors a variety of scenarios, including disorderly transition, measured/regulated transition considering volatility along the SOFR curve and clearinghouse plans to change their discount rates to alternative reference rates, and IBOR in continuity beyond December 2021.
The Firm continues to monitor and facilitate the transition by clients from IBOR-referencing products to products referencing alternative reference rates. The Firm’s transition efforts to date include:
• ongoing implementation of new fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked syndicated loans, securitizations, floating rate notes and bi-lateral business loans based on the recommendations of the ARRC, and introducing SOFR as a replacement benchmark rate for certain of these products;
• planning to adopt further fallback provisions recommended by the ARRC, including for residential ARMs, in conjunction with the adoption of these provisions by market participants; and
• completing its first bilateral SOFR loan in the U.S. and executing its first interest rate swap linked to the Euro short-term rate in Europe.
Market participants are continuing to work closely with the public sector as part of National Working Groups (“NWGs”) towards the common goal of facilitating an orderly transition from IBORs. Current NWG efforts include the continued development of cash and derivative markets referencing alternative reference rates, as well as the development of industry consensus for fallback language that would determine the replacement rates to use in various IBOR-indexed contracts when a particular IBOR ceases to be produced. The Firm is monitoring and providing input in the development of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”), which is expected to be published in 2020, and is encouraging its clients to actively participate in ISDA and industry consultations in order to ensure the broadest possible industry engagement in and understanding of IBOR transition. The Firm continues to monitor the development of alternative reference rates in other jurisdictions with NWGs.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has confirmed that it will issue an accounting standards update in 2020 providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedge relationships affected by benchmark reform. The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has made amendments to IFRS hedge accounting requirements that provide relief to market participants on the accounting treatment of IBOR-linked products in the period leading up to the expected cessation of IBORs and is also considering further relief for the accounting impacts upon transition to an alternative reference rate.
The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that are intended to avoid adverse tax consequences in connection with the transition from IBORs. Under the proposed regulations, amendments to contracts meeting certain requirements will not be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the FASB, IASB and U.S. Treasury Department regarding accounting and tax implications of reference rate reform. The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR discontinuation as identified alternative reference rates develop and liquidity in these rates increases. The Firm will continue to engage with regulators and clients as the transition from IBORs progresses.

Management’s discussion and analysis
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, unless otherwise specified. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 48-51 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”) for a discussion of the 2018 versus 2017 results. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. Refer to pages 136–138 for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several accounting standards. Certain of the accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.
– higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, reflecting an overall strong performance, primarily in agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products; the increase in 2019 also reflected the impact of challenging market conditions in Credit in the fourth quarter of 2018; and
– the favorable impact of tighter funding spreads on derivatives in Credit Adjustments & Other.
The net increase in CIB was partially offset by
• lower revenue in AWM related to hedges on certain investments. The impact of these hedges was more than offset by higher valuation gains on the related investments reflected in other income
Principal transactions revenue in Corporate was relatively flat, reflecting the combined impact of losses on cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions, and lower net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB, AWM and Corporate segment results on pages 66-70, pages 74–76 and pages 77–78, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in customer accounts and transactions, and higher lending- related commitment fees in the wholesale businesses.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 62–65, pages 66-70 and pages 71–73, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased primarily due to higher asset management fees from growth in client investment assets in CCB.
Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 62–65 and pages 74–76, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.
Investment securities gains/(losses) in both periods reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 77– 78 and Note 10 for additional information.

Investment banking fees were relatively flat, reflecting in CIB:
• higher debt underwriting fees driven by wallet share gains and increased activity in investment-grade and high-yield bonds,
offset by
• lower advisory fees driven by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share gains.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 66-70 and Note 6 for additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting:
• higher revenue in CIB, which included a gain on the initial public offering (“IPO”) of Tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding this gain, the increase in CIB’s revenue was driven by:
48
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Mortgage fees and related income increased driven by:
• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting approximately $500 million of gains on sales of certain loans, as well as higher mortgage production volumes and margins,
partially offset by
• lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 62–65, Note 6 and 15 for further information.
Card income increased as the prior year included an adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Excluding this item, Card income was relatively flat. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 62–65 and Note 6 for further information.
Other income increased reflecting:
• higher operating lease income from growth in auto
operating lease volume in CCB, and
• higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were largely offset by the impact of the related hedges that were reflected in principal transactions revenue,
largely offset by
• lower other income in CIB largely related to increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits.
The prior year included:
• $505 million of fair value gains related to the adoption in the first quarter of 2018 of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.
Refer to Note 6 for further information.
Net interest income increased driven by continued balance sheet growth and changes in mix, as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher rates paid on deposits.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 trillion, up $133 billion, and the yield was 3.61%, up 14 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.46%, a decrease of 6 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.27%, up 2bps.
Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 57–59 for a further discussion of this measure.

The increase in the wholesale provision reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select client downgrades. The prior year reflected a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher recoveries.
largely offset by
• a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card, in CCB due to
– a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the purchase credit-impaired (“PCI”) residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and
– a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio
partially offset by
– lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.

The effective tax rate decreased due to the recognition of $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits, and changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. The decrease was partially offset by lower tax benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards. In addition, the prior year included a $302 million net tax benefit resulting from changes in the estimates under the TCJA related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. Refer to Note 25 for further information.
(b) Included FDIC-related expense of $457 million, $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
2019 compared with 2018
Compensation expense increased driven by investments across the businesses, including front office, as well as technology staff hires.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher investments across the businesses, including
technology, real estate and marketing
• higher volume-related expense, including depreciation from growth in auto lease assets in CCB, and brokerage expense in certain businesses in CIB
• higher legal expense, and
• higher pension costs due to changes to actuarial assumptions and estimates,
largely offset by
• lower FDIC charges as a result of the elimination of the surcharge at the end of the third quarter of 2018
• the impact of efficiencies
• lower other regulatory-related assessments in CIB.
The prior year included a loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity in Corporate recorded in other expense. Refer to Note 24 for additional information on the liquidation of a legal entity.

Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements decreased as a result of client-driven market- making activities in Fixed Income Markets in CIB and a shift in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note 10 for additional information.
Securities borrowed increased in CIB related to client- driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets, and to cover customer short positions in prime brokerage. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note 10 for additional information.
Trading assets was relatively flat, reflecting:
• a reduction in short-term instruments associated with
cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO, offset by
• growth in client-driven activities in CIB Markets, primarily debt instruments, and
• in CCB, growth related to originations of mortgage warehouse loans, resulting from the favorable rate environment.

Investment securities increased primarily due to net purchases of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS in Treasury and CIO. The net purchases were primarily driven by cash deployment and interest rate risk management activities. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 77–78, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 118 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment securities.
Loans decreased reflecting loan sales in Home Lending, and lower loans in CIB, primarily driven by a loan syndication and net paydowns, partially offset by growth in AWM and Card.
The allowance for loan losses decreased driven by:
• an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 million in the business banking portfolio; as well as
• a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans,
largely offset by
• a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and
higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, and
• a $115 million addition in the wholesale allowance for loan losses driven by select client downgrades.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 100–118, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Premises and equipment increased primarily due to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased reflecting lower MSRs as a result of the realization of expected cash flows and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates, partially offset by net additions to the MSRs. The decrease

   Deposits increased reflecting:
• continued growth driven by new accounts in CCB
• growth in operating deposits in CIB driven by client activity, primarily in Treasury Services, and an increase in client-driven net issuances of structured notes in Markets, and
• higher deposits in CB and AWM from growth in interest- bearing deposits; for AWM, the growth was partially offset by migration, predominantly into the Firm’s investment- related products.
Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 93–98; and Notes 2 and 17 for more information.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements was relatively flat,as the net increase from the Firm’s participation in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations was offset by client- driven activities, and lower secured financing of trading assets-debt instruments, all in CIB. Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 93–98 and Note 11 for additional information.
Short-term borrowings decreased reflecting lower commercial paper issuances and short-term advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) in Treasury and CIO, primarily driven by liquidity management. Refer to pages 93–98 for information on changes in Liquidity Risk Management.
Trading liabilities decreased due to client-driven market- making activities in CIB, which resulted in lower levels of short positions in both debt and equity instruments in Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting: • the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting
guidance effective January 1, 2019, and
• higher client payables related to client-driven activities in CIB.
Refer to Note 18 for additional information on Leases.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased due to:
• maturities of credit card securitizations,
largely offset by
• higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper issued to third parties.
Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on pages 55–56 and Note 14 and 28 for further information on Firm- sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Management’s discussion and analysis
Consolidated cash flows analysis
The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Consolidated cash flows analysis on page 54 of the Firm’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2017 activities.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.
• In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment.
• In 2018, cash used reflected an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements, higher net originations of loans and net purchases of investment securities.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred and common stock.
• In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and net payments of long term borrowings.
• In 2018, cash provided reflected higher deposits, short- term borrowings, and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments of long term borrowings.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.

           JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments and net proceeds of sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase in other assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.
• In 2018, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments, increased trading liabilities and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in trading assets and net originations of loans held-for-sale.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS
 In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).
Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special- purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).
The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE- related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.
The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct.
The table below provides an index of where in this 2019 Form 10-K a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 146–150. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow
management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 60–78 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Management’s discussion and analysis
Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets businesses
In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB’s Markets businesses, as shown below; these metrics, which exclude CIB’s Markets businesses, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics that exclude CIB’s Markets businesses are referred to as non-markets-related net interest income and net yield. CIB’s Markets businesses are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets-related net interest income and net yield provides investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.
The Firm also reviews adjusted expense, which is noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense and is therefore a non-GAAP financial measure. Additionally, certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. Management believes that these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provide an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 100–118 for additional information on credit metrics and ratios excluding PCI loans.
 Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
Return on assets (“ROA”)
Reported net income / Total average assets
Return on common equity (“ROE”)
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
Tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”)
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end * Represents net income applicable to common equity

These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS
Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

Key performance measures
Core loans is considered a key performance measure. Core loans represents loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses, and excludes loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans is a measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

Management’s discussion and analysis
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures, on pages 57–59 for a definition of managed basis.

The revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business will be reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items, described in more detail below. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.
Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service on a gross basis, with an allocation to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations not currently leveraged by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes parent company costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align corporate support units; and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.
Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to each business segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements on a product-by-product basis within each business segment. This process is overseen by senior management and reviewed by the Firm’s Treasurer Committee.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the Firm’s process to allocate capital. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business segment’s net income applicable to common equity.
Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 90 for additional information on business segment capital allocation.

Note: In the discussion and the tables which follow, CCB presents certain financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans; these are non- GAAP financial measures.
(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
(b) Included MSR risk management results of $(165) million, $(111) million and $(242) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

2019 compared with 2018
Net income was $16.6 billion, an increase of 12%.
Net revenue was $55.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Net production revenue included approximately $500 million of gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans that were predominantly offset by charges in net interest income for the unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and CIO associated with these loans. The charges reflect the net present value of that funding and is recognized as interest income in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate on pages 77– 78 and Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) on page 61 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Net interest income was $37.2 billion, up 4%, and included charges from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding these charges, net interest income increased, driven by:
• higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, as well as higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances in CBB,
partially offset by
• lower loan balances due to loan sales, as well as loan spread compression in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $18.6 billion, up 15%, and included gains from the loan sales mentioned above as well as the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Excluding these notable items, noninterest revenue increased 9%, driven by:
• higher auto lease volume, and
• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production volumes and margins,
partially offset by
• lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale.
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.
Noninterest expense was $28.9 billion, up 4%, driven by:
• investments in the business including technology and marketing and higher depreciation on auto lease assets,
partially offset by
• expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
The provision for credit losses was $5.0 billion, an increase of 4%, reflecting:
• an increase in credit card due to
– higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with expectations, and
– a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, compared to a $300 million addition in the prior year
largely offset by
• a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to
– a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and
– a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio
partially offset by
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

–
lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.

Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing.
At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $961 million, $2.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
Net charge-offs/(recoveries) and the net charge-off/(recovery) rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, excluded $151 million, $187 million and $86 million, respectively, of write-offs in the PCI portfolio. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses on page 117 for further information on PCI write-offs.
Excludes the impact of PCI loans. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the net charge-off/(recovery) rates including the impact of PCI loans were as follows: (1) home equity of (0.15)%, (0.02)% and 0.14%, respectively; (2) residential mortgage of (0.03)%, (0.14)% and (0.01)%, respectively; (3)
2017
 
Home Lending of (0.05)%, (0.12)% and 0.02%, respectively; and (4) total CCB
of 1.14%, 0.98% and 1.12%, respectively.
(e) At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, excluded mortgage loans insured by
U.S. government agencies of $1.7 billion, $4.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(f) Excludes PCI loans. The 30+ day delinquency rate for PCI loans was 8.44%, 9.16% and 10.13% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
(g) Excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio transfer, the total net charge-off rates for the full year 2017 would have been 1.10%.

Investment Banking revenue was $7.2 billion, up 3%, with higher debt underwriting fees, largely offset by lower advisory and equity underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with overall share gains, according to Dealogic.
– Debt underwriting fees were $3.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting wallet share gains and increased activity in investment-grade and high-yield bonds.
– Advisory fees were $2.4 billion, down 5%, and Equity underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, down 1%, driven by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share gains.
Treasury Services revenue was $4.6 billion, down 3%, driven by deposit margin compression predominantly offset by higher balances and fee growth.
Lending revenue was $1.3 billion, up 3%, with higher net interest income largely offset by losses on hedges of accrual loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.2 billion, up 7%. Markets revenue was $20.9 billion, up 7% which included a gain on the IPO of Tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019. Prior year results included approximately $500 million of fair value gains recorded in the first quarter of 2018 related to the adoption of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $14.4 billion, up 13%, reflecting an overall strong performance, notably in Securitized Products. The increase in 2019 also reflected the impact of challenging market conditions in Credit and Rates in the fourth quarter of 2018.
• Equity Markets revenue was $6.5 billion, down 6%, compared to a strong prior year, driven by lower client activity in derivatives partially offset by higher client activity in Cash Equities.
• Securities Services revenue was $4.2 billion, down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression and the impact of a business exit largely offset by organic growth.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $121 million reflecting tighter funding spreads on derivatives, compared with a loss of $373 million in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $277 million, compared with a $60 million net benefit in the prior year. This increase reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select client downgrades, and a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher recoveries, both in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $21.5 billion, up 3%, predominantly driven by higher volume-related expenses and investments, including front office and technology staff hires, as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.

Allowance for loan losses of $110 million, $174 million and $316 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.
Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory- related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to,
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is driven by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

2019 compared with 2018
Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 7%.
Net revenue was $9.0 billion, a decrease of 1%. Net interest income was $6.6 billion, a decrease of 2%, predominantly driven by lower deposit margins. Noninterest revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4%, driven by higher investment banking revenue, predominantly due to increased equity underwriting and M&A activity, and growth in lending and deposit related fees.
Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by continued investments in the business, largely offset by lower FDIC charges.
The provision for credit losses was $296 million, up from $129 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses on select client downgrades in the current year and higher recoveries in the prior year.

Management’s discussion and analysis
 CB product revenue consists of the following:
Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets. Products include term loans, revolving lines of credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and standby letters of credit.
Treasury services includes revenue from a broad range of products and services that enable CB clients to manage payments and receipts, as well as invest and manage funds.
Investment banking includes revenue from a range of products providing CB clients with sophisticated capital- raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet and risk management tools through advisory, equity underwriting, and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed Income and Equity Markets products used by CB clients is also included.

Selected income statement data
2019 compared with 2018
Net income was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 1%.
Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 2%. Net interest income was $3.5 billion, down 1%, driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up 3%, driven by higher net investment valuation gains and growth in fees on higher average market levels, partially offset by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products.
Revenue from Asset Management was $7.3 billion, up 1%, driven by higher investment valuation gains. The impact on fees from higher average market levels was more than offset by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products.
Revenue from Wealth Management was $7.1 billion, up 2%, driven by loan and deposit growth, growth in fees on the cumulative impact of net inflows and higher average market levels and brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression.
The provision for credit losses was $61 million, up from $53 million in the prior year, reflecting higher net-charge offs, as well as net additions to the allowance for loan losses, predominantly due to loan growth.
Noninterest expense was $10.5 billion, an increase of 2%, predominantly driven by investments in the business as well as volume- and revenue-related expenses.

 Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry- wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers mentioned in footnote (a). The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers mentioned in footnote (b). Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re- denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds and at the “primary share class” level or fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness. The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Selected income statement and balance sheet data
2019 compared with 2018
Net Income was $1.1 billion compared with a net loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $1.2 billion, compared with a net loss of $128 million in the prior year driven by higher net interest income and noninterest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by balance sheet growth and changes in mix, and also includes income related to the unwind of the internal funding provided to CCB upon the sale of certain mortgage loans. The income reflects the net present value of that funding and is recognized as a charge to net interest income in CCB. Refer to CCB on pages 62–65 and FTP on page 61 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Noninterest revenue increased reflecting:
• investment securities gains, compared with losses in the
prior year, due to the repositioning of the investment
securities portfolio, and
• lower net markdowns on certain legacy private equity
investments, partially offset by

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:
• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm;
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and
• Firmwide structures for risk governance.
The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.
Drivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and government policy, competitor and market evolution, business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.
Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:
• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.
• Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM organization and manage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee in the form of the primary risk management policies. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, set the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span across the individual LOB, functions and regions.
Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each of its LOBs and Corporate areas giving rise to risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards. Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management are the Firm’s “first line of defense” and own the identification of risks, as well as the design and execution of controls to manage those risks. The first line of defense is responsible for adherence

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.

Management’s discussion and analysis
to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation of the risk management structure (which may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and controls) established by IRM.
The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function sets and oversees the risk management structure for Firmwide risk governance, and independently assesses and challenges the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation of policies and standards established by IRM with respect to its own processes.
The Internal Audit function operates independently from other parts of the Firm and performs independent testing and evaluation of processes and controls across the Firm as the “third line of defense.” The Internal Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment including Finance, Human Resources, Legal and Control Management.
Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate area owns the ongoing identification of risks, as well as the design and execution of controls, inclusive of IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification process designed to facilitate their responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository and review the most material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identification of risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk Committee.
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a “Risk Appetite” framework. The framework and the Firm’s risk appetite are set and approved by the Firm’s CEO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and CRO. Quantitative parameters and qualitative factors are used to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Qualitative factors have been established to assess select operational risks that impact the Firm’s reputation. Risk Appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.
80
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.
The chart below illustrates the Board of Directors’ and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the oversight of risk which are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.
 The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors provides oversight of risk. The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment, and the Compensation & Management Development Committee oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this function acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee.

Management’s discussion and analysis
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, independence and performance, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.
The Compensation & Management Development Committee (“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and benefits programs. In addition, the Committee reviews Operating Committee members’ performance against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. The CMDC also reviews the development of and succession for key executives, and provides oversight of the Firm’s culture, including reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related employee actions, including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the Firm's reputation among all of its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also appraises the framework for assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation.
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by underlying committees and/or FRC members.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation committee for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment including identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated.
The Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Governance Committee (“FFRGC”) provides oversight of the governance framework for fiduciary risk or fiduciary-related conflict of interest risk inherent in each of the Firm’s LOBs. The FFRGC approves risk or compliance policy exceptions and reviews periodic reports from the LOBs and control functions including fiduciary metrics and control trends.
The Firmwide Estimations Risk Committee (“FERC”) provides oversight of the governance framework for quantitative and qualitative estimations and models as specified in the Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The FERC also has responsibility to set the prioritization of estimations and model risk activities and drive consistency through review of LOB activities and escalated issues.
The Conduct Risk Steering Committee (“CRSC”) is responsible for reviewing, calibrating and consolidating Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite and setting overall direction for the Firm’s Conduct Risk Program.
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for providing oversight of the governance, limits, and controls that are in place through the scope of their activities. These committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the business operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees.
Line of Business and Corporate Control Committees oversee the control environment of their respective business or function. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may impact the quality and stability of the processes in a business or function, addressing key operational risk issues, focusing on processes with control concerns and overseeing control remediation.
Line of Business Reputation Risk Committees review and assess transactions, activities and clients that have the potential for material reputation risk to the Firm.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The Firmwide Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management (“ALM”) activities and the management of liquidity risk, balance sheet, interest rate risk, and capital risk. The ALCO is supported by the Treasurer Committee and the Capital Governance Committee. The Treasurer Committee is responsible for monitoring the Firm’s overall balance sheet, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Capital Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and providing guidance concerning the effectiveness of the Firm’s capital framework, capital policies and regulatory capital implementation.
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of fair value risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The scope of a particular function may include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.

Management’s discussion and analysis
STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen by IRM through participation in business reviews, LOB and Corporate senior management committees and other relevant governance forums and ongoing discussions. The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management framework.
In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate leadership identify the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification process and monitored and assessed as part of the Firmwide Risk Appetite framework.
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm.
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”), the Operating Committee and management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-level strategic framework and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.
These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the Board for review.
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk- adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 for further information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 for further information on liquidity risk. In addition, for further information on reputation risk, refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 99.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making any significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function whose primary objective is to provide independent assessment, measuring, monitoring and control of capital risk across the Firm.
Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches; and
• Performing an independent assessment of the Firm’s capital management activities, including changes made to the contingency capital plan described below.
In addition, the Basel Independent Review function (“BIR”), which is a part of the IRM function, conducts independent assessments of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework. These assessments are intended to ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory capital rules in support of senior management’s responsibility for managing capital and for the Board Risk Committee’s oversight of management in executing that responsibility.
Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.
The primary objectives of effective capital management are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;
• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through establishing internal minimum capital requirements and a strong capital management governance framework, both in business as usual conditions and in the event of stress.
Capital risk management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. In its management of capital, the Firm takes into consideration economic risk and all applicable regulatory capital requirements to determine the level of capital needed.
The Firm considers regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events, when setting its minimum capital levels. The capital governance framework requires regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital positions, stress testing and defining escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Treasurer Committee and the Firmwide ALCO. Capital management oversight is governed through the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) risk committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 79–83 for additional discussion on the Board Risk Committee and the ALCO.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit on an annual basis a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large bank holding companies (“BHC”) have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.

Management’s discussion and analysis
On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan. Refer to Capital actions on pages 90-91 for information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 2019 CCAR results.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning.
The CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However, when defining a broad range of scenarios, actual events can always be worse. Accordingly, management considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. These results are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors.
Contingency capital plan
The Firm’s contingency capital plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and during stress. The contingency capital plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the fully phased-in measures under Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 the results were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis.
Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 for additional information.
Key Regulatory Developments
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) guidance under U.S. GAAP. As provided by the U.S. banking agencies, the Firm elected to phase-in the impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to regulatory capital, at 25 percent per year in each of 2020 to 2023 (“CECL transitional period”). Based on the Firm’s capital as of December 31, 2019, the estimated impact to the Standardized CET1 capital ratio will be a reduction of approximately 4 bps for each transitional year. Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on pages 139-140 and Note 1 for further information.

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III minimum CET1 capital ratio during the Basel III transitional periods and on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III rules currently in effect.
 The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk- based ratios, and the Firm expects that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold additional amounts of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb losses in times of financial or economic stress. The capital conservation buffer was subject to a phase-in period that began January 1, 2016 and continued through the end of 2018.
As an expansion of the capital conservation buffer, the Firm is also required to hold additional levels of capital in the form of a global systemically important bank (“GSIB”) surcharge and a countercyclical capital buffer.
Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to calculate its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods, and is subject to the higher of the two. The first (“Method 1”), reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. The second (“Method 2”), modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score
“multiplication factor”. The following table presents the Firm’s GSIB surcharge.

(a) The GSIB surcharge was subject to transition provisions (in 25% increments) through the end of 2018.
The Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under Method 2 remains unchanged at 3.5% for 2020.
The Federal Reserve's framework for setting the countercyclical capital buffer takes into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2019, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer may result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common equity repurchases.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Minimums
Supplementary leverage ratio
The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on- balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be

Management’s discussion and analysis
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.
Failure to maintain an SLR ratio equal to or greater than the regulatory minimum may result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common equity repurchases.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

Line of business equity
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. The Firm will assess impacts from any regulatory changes to the capital framework as changes are finalized.
The table below presents the Firm’s assessed level of capital allocated to each LOB as of the dates indicated.

The Firm from time to time enters into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.
The authorization to repurchase common equity is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans; and may be suspended by management at any time.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a liquidity risk oversight function whose primary objective is to provide independent assessment, measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;
• Establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including Liquidity Risk Appetite;
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;
• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes;
• Monitoring and reporting internal firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests as well as regulatory defined liquidity stress tests;
• Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions; and
• Monitoring liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities;
Liquidity management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to:
• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and
• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach in order to:
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses;
• Monitor exposures;
• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.
In the context of the Firm’s liquidity management, Treasury and CIO is responsible for:
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;
• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;
• Defining and monitoring firmwide and legal entity- specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;
• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;
• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and
• Setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 79–83 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk- related committees.
Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:
• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets,
• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows, and
• Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.
Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.
Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum

Management’s discussion and analysis
liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s contingency funding plan (“CFP”), which is approved by the firmwide ALCO and the Board Risk Committee, is a compilation of procedures and action plans for managing liquidity through stress events. The CFP incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify emerging risks or vulnerabilities in the Firm’s liquidity position. The CFP identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.
Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA.
Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.
The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with both the three- month periods ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, due to an increase in HQLA from unsecured long- term debt issuances. Additionally, liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the fourth quarter and from the prior year period primarily due to growth in stable deposits. This increase in excess liquidity is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.
The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity of approximately $315 billion and $226 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This includes securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non- bank affiliates, as described above. The amount of such securities increased from the prior year.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $322 billion and $276 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in collateral available to be pledged as a result of the merger of Chase Bank USA, N.A. with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and an increase in available collateral as a result of maturities of borrowings from FHLBs. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-term secured
Deposits
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent company or the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period- end deposit balances.
Average deposits across the Firm increased for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in CIB reflects growth in operating deposits driven by client activity, primarily in Treasury Services, and an increase in client-driven net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by continued growth in new accounts. The increases in AWM and CB were primarily driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits; for AWM, the growth was partially offset by migration, predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase were relatively flat at December 31, 2019, compared with December 31, 2018, as the net increase from the Firm’s participation in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations was offset by client-driven activities, and lower secured financing of trading assets-debt instruments, all in CIB.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at December 31, 2019, from December 31, 2018, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.

Management’s discussion and analysis
Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third- party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019, were as follows.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence held by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public.
Organization and management
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk management function that establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the following activities:
• Establishing a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance
policy and standards consistent with the reputation risk framework
• Managing the governance infrastructure and processes that support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide
• Providing guidance to LOB Reputation Risk Offices (“RRO”), as appropriate
The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities, investment securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management is an independent risk management function that monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities:
• Establishing a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines
• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure
• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans
• Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
The Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures, manages and limits credit risk across the Firm’s businesses. To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for- investment loan portfolios, and the allowance for lending- related commitments reflects credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments. Refer to Note 13 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 136-138 for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be modified through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. In addition, wrong-way risk, that is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing - is actively monitored as this risk could result in greater exposure at default compared with a transaction with another counterparty that does not have this risk.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval process
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:
• Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale and commercial-oriented retail credit portfolios, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and
• Evaluating the effectiveness of business units’ credit management processes, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/LGD rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision- making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $961 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of $41 million and $75 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”).

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, and business banking loans, as well as associated lending- related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Originated mortgage loans are retained in the mortgage portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to benefit from discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by low unemployment and increasing home prices. Refer to Note 12 for further information on the consumer loan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for further information on lending-related commitments.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2018 due to lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by loan sales.
The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products, excluding PCI loans which are addressed separately. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.
Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2018 driven by paydowns as well as loan sales in Home Lending, largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the year ended
December 31, 2019 were lower when compared with the prior year as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $22.4 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019 was consistent with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period.
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.
(“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3–30 years. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization period.
The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $22 billion at December 31, 2019. This amount included $10 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $3 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.
Auto: The auto portfolio predominantly consists of prime- quality loans. The portfolio declined when compared with December 31, 2018, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new originations.
Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business Banking loans increased when compared with
December 31, 2018 as loan originations were predominantly offset by paydowns and charge-offs of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased when compared with the prior year primarily due to higher deposit overdraft losses.
Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans represent certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit- impaired on the acquisition date. PCI loans decreased from December 31, 2018 due to portfolio run-off. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 9% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 71% of the portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining option ARM loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment.

Amounts represent the carrying value of modified residential real estate loans.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $14 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.
Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, nonaccrual loans included $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due.

Active and suspended foreclosure: Refer to Note 12 for information on loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.
Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2018 due to higher sales volume from existing customers and new account growth. Net charge-offs increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared with the prior year, due to loan growth, in line with expectations.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and reduces interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2019, $77.5 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $71.2 billion, or 45%, at December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.
Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm had $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loan modification programs for borrowers.

Management’s discussion and analysis
WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.
The credit performance of the wholesale portfolio remained favorable for the year ended December 31, 2019, characterized by continued low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 109–111 for further information. Loans held-for-sale decreased, driven by a loan syndication in CIB. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. It excludes all exposure managed by CCB, scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and scored prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $14.3 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $12.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by select client downgrades.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.
Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for- investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such no allowance is held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
Clearing services
The Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts. Through the provision of these services the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease the provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to Note 28 for a further discussion of clearing services.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.
The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.

(a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $49.8 billion and $54.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $16.0 billion and $15.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.
While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure

Management’s discussion and analysis
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of collateral. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the Firm’s
exposure to a counterparty (AVG) and the counterparty’s credit quality. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with that counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.
Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2019 (in billions)
 The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

Total
As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 90% at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities.

(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index.
The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for a detailed description of credit derivatives.

Management’s discussion and analysis
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments.
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 136–138 and Note 13 for further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.
At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.
The allowance for credit losses decreased compared with December 31, 2018 driven by:
• an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 million in the business banking portfolio; as well as
• a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans,
predominantly offset by
• a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and
higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, and
• a $251 million addition in the wholesale allowance for credit losses driven by select client downgrades.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 103–107, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 108–115 and Note 12 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.

Management’s discussion and analysis
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At December 31, 2019, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was $396.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 77–78 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 119–126 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 for further information on related liquidity risk.
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk Committee.
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.
Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $24.2 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $18.2 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.0 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk policy framework exists for all principal investing activities and includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.
Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:
• Establishing a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk
There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk (VaR)
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns
• Earnings-at-risk
• Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management experience. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are escalated to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with appropriate members of the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis
The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.
In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures (i.e., VaR or Other sensitivity-based measures) and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 118 for additional discussion on principal investments.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR “back-testing exceptions,” defined as losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates, an average of five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR back-testing exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of back-testing exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.
The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

       (a) Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.
(b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.
Average Total VaR increased $2 million for the year-ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year. This was predominantly due to increased exposure in the Fixed Income risk type, increases in the Equities risk type driven by the inclusion of Tradeweb following its IPO in the second quarter of 2019, and increased volatility in the one-year historical look-back period, partially offset by increases in diversification benefit.
In addition, average CCB VaR increased by $4 million, driven by MSR risk management activities.
VaR back-testing
The Firm performs daily VaR model back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue.
The Firm’s definition, of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition, market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding select components of revenue such as fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments, net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading.

 framework and are subject to the standards outlined in the
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are
Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 120 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.
Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off- balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long- term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. All transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.
Stress testing
 Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to
 assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to
 adverse changes in markets using recent historical market
 behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from
 hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive
 positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures
 the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed
 but possible economic and market scenarios. The results
 are used to understand the exposures responsible for those
 potential losses and are measured against limits.
 The Firm’s stress framework covers Corporate and all LOBs
 with market risk sensitive positions. The framework is used
 to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both
 market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant
 changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity
 prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,
 and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of
 hypothetical economic and market scenarios.
 The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail
 events in specific asset classes and geographies, including
 how the event may impact multiple market factors
 simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific
 idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different
 products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the
 Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes
 against possible future stress events. Stress testing results
 are reported on a regular basis to senior management of
 the Firm, as appropriate.
 Stress scenarios are governed by an overall stress
  Firm’s policies related to model risk management.
 Significant changes to the framework are reviewed as
 appropriate.
 The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating
  reported to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress
 testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite
 framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk
 Committee.
 Profit and loss drawdowns
 Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading
 losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and
 loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date
 peak level.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 120.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates or decreasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags and other factors.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to the 2020 Outlook on page 45 for additional information).

    The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short- term and long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm’s sensitivity to short- term rates reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower rates but changes in the Firm’s balance sheet more than offset the impacts of the lower rates. The Firm’s sensitivity to long-term rates increased as a result of updates to the Firm’s baseline to reflect lower rates in addition to changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. The increased sensitivity to long-term rates is more impactful to the downward scenario due to the Firm’s sensitivity to mortgage prepayments.

 Sources and measurement
 The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
 deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether
 cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes
 activity with both government and private-sector entities in
 a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk
 management approach, attribution of exposure to a specific
 country is based on the country where the largest
 proportion of the assets of the
counterparty, issuer, obligor
  or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of
 its revenue is derived, which may be different than the
 domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation of
 the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor. Country
 exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm’s
 risk to an immediate default of the counterparty, issuer,
 obligor or guarantor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are
 sometimes required in determining the measurement and
 allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of
 certain non-linear or index exposures. The use of different
 measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the
 amount of reported country exposure.

Stress testing
 Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s
 country risk management framework, which aims to
 estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by
 measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to
 a country based on market shocks combined with
 counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk
 Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress
 scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or
 of countries in response to specific or potential market
 events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and
 geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to
 inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as
 necessary.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk.
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate hold ownership, responsibility and accountability for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework and the evaluation of the effectiveness of their control environments to determine where targeted remediation efforts may be required.
LOBs and Corporate control committees are responsible for reviewing data that indicates the quality and stability of processes, addressing key operational risk issues, focusing on processes with control concerns, and overseeing control remediation.
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing minimum standards for its execution. Operational Risk Officers (“OROs”) report to both the LOB CROs and to the FRE for Operational Risk, and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee.
The Firm’s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR Management Framework for the Firm. The CCOR Management Framework is articulated in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy which is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self- assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. CCOR Management
provides oversight of these activities and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
CCOR Management performs independent risk assessments of the Firm’s operational risks, which includes assessing the effectiveness of the control environment and reporting the results to senior management.
In addition, operational risk measurement includes operational risk-based capital and operational risk loss projections under both baseline and stressed conditions.
The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress testing processes.
Refer to Capital Risk Management section, on pages 85–92 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by CCOR Management are leveraged as one of the key criteria in the independent monitoring and testing of the LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with laws and regulation. Through monitoring and testing, CCOR Management independently identifies areas of operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.

Management’s discussion and analysis
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. CCOR Management may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for employees at the Firm. Risks identified by CCOR Management are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. CCOR Management has established standards to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk indicators and key performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement processes. Refer to pages 132, 133, and 134, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below.
Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is an important, continuous and evolving focus for the Firm. The Firm devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyberdefense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions of cybersecurity risks with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic.
Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity
risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.
To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Audit Committee is updated periodically on the Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as its efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.
The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s Information Security Program. In partnership with the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and Technology Control organization identifies information security risk issues and oversees programs for the technological protection of the Firm’s information resources including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential and personal information related to the Firm’s customers. The Cybersecurity and Technology organization is comprised of business aligned information security managers that are supported within the organization by the following products that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:
• Cyber Defense & Fraud
• Data Management, Protection & Privacy • Identity & Access Management
• Governance & Controls
• Production Management & Resiliency
• Software & Platform Enablement
The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor
130
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm and include representatives from each LOB and Corporate. Reports containing overviews of key technology risks and efforts to enhance related controls are produced for these forums, and are reviewed by management at multiple levels. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate.
The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.
The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.
Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics. The safety of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption. The program includes governance, awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after various events.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level across the industry. The complexities of these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators continue to evolve. Under the Payments Control Program, methods are developed for managing the risk, implementing controls, and providing employee and client education and awareness trainings. The Firm’s monitoring of customer behavior is periodically
evaluated and enhanced in an effort to detect and mitigate new strategies implemented by fraud perpetrators.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) framework assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework is to hold suppliers to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks including data loss and business disruption. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.

Management’s discussion and analysis
COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing compliance risk. The Firm’s Compliance Organization (“Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of legal and regulatory obligations, depending on the LOB and the jurisdiction, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the rules and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care (such as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of clients and customers or to treat clients and customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.
CCOR Management implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report compliance risk.
Governance and oversight
Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s CCO also provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee. In addition, certain Special Purpose Committees of the Board have previously been established to oversee the Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders.
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does business. The Code requires employees to promptly report any known or suspected violation of the Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. All newly hired employees are assigned Code training and current employees are periodically assigned Code training on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code periodically.
Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Code Reporting Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.
 132
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides information and resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance with the laws everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 132 for further discussion of the Code.
Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management policy, which establishes the framework for governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the Firm.
The Conduct Risk Steering Committee (CRSC) provides oversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus.
Each committee of the Board oversees conduct risks within its scope of responsibilities, and the CRSC may escalate to such committees as appropriate.
Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and designated corporate functions completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides business conduct training as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis
LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.
Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:
• managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters, including internal reviews and investigations related to such matters
• advising on products and services, including contract negotiation and documentation
• advising on offering and marketing documents and new business initiatives
• managing dispute resolution
• interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on changes thereto
• advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and
• providing legal advice to the LOBs and Corporate, in alignment with the lines of defense described under Firmwide Risk Management on pages 79–83.
Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and other members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors and periodically to the Audit Committee.
Legal serves on and advises various committees (including new business initiative and reputation risk committees) and advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.
 134
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.
The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach to the approach used for models, which is described in detail below.
Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to the Model Risk function for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.
Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the Model Risk function. In its review of a model, the Model Risk function considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the Model Risk function based on the relevant model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 136–138 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

Management’s discussion and analysis
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM
 JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loans to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending- related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. Refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 116– 117 and Note 13 for further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.
Allowance for credit losses sensitivity
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.
To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of December 31, 2019, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:
• A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply:
an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $250 million for PCI loans.
an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $50 million for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans.
• For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $850 million.
• An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.6 billion.
• A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $200 million.
The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate.
Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other
  136
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual and projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of December 31, 2019. The fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 15% or higher and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.
The projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current short-term business outlook assumptions, and in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and returns on equity of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2019.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor

The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,

Management’s discussion and analysis
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The rewards liability is sensitive to various assumptions, including cost per point and redemption rates for each of the various rewards programs, which are evaluated periodically. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $6.4 billion and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined
that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2019, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.
Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.
Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.

Establishes a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the full remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.
Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, with a corresponding increase in the recorded investment of the related loans.
Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write- offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral dependent assets).
Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves.
Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption.
Requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value.
Eliminates the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value.

Adopted January 1, 2020.
The adoption of this guidance resulted in a net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion and a decrease to retained earnings of $2.7 billion, primarily driven by Card. Under the CECL framework, the Firm estimates losses over a two-year forecast period using the weighted-average of a range of macroeconomic scenarios (established on a Firmwide basis), and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience to estimate losses over more extended periods.
The Firm elected to phase-in the impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to regulatory capital, at 25 percent per year in each of 2020 to 2023 (“CECL transitional period”). Based on the Firm’s capital as of December 31, 2019, the estimated impact to the Standardized CET1 capital ratio will be a reduction of approximately 4 bps for each transitional year.
As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. The difference between their carrying amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm’s cumulative-effect adjustment.
Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Adopted January 1, 2020.
No impact upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied prospectively.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making the assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $802.8 billion of its assets and $233.8 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $8.1 billion of trading assets and $37.7 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates and correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s processes for determining fair value which include controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs; and comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value.
Fair Value of Mortgage Servicing Rights Assets
As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm has elected to account for the Firm’s mortgage servicing rights assets at fair value, with balances of $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Management estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights using an option-adjusted spread model, which projects cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are prepayment speeds and option adjusted spread.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of mortgage servicing rights assets is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to the prepayment speed and option adjusted spread assumptions, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, including controls over the Firm’s models, assumptions, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in testing management’s process including testing and evaluating the reasonableness of prepayment speed and option adjusted spread assumptions used in the model.
Allowance for Loan Losses - Wholesale Loan, Credit Card Loan and Consumer Loan Portfolios
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios, which primarily consists of wholesale loans, credit card loans and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses was $13.1 billion on total retained loans of $945.6 billion. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses is determined for each of the retained loan portfolios utilizing a statistical credit loss estimate. These statistical credit loss estimates are calculated using statistical credit loss factors, specifically the probability of default and loss severity for the credit card and consumer loans and the probability of default and loss given default for the wholesale loans. Management then applies judgment to adjust these statistical loss estimates to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan, credit card loan, and consumer loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) there was
144

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the modeling techniques utilized in their statistical credit loss estimates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the statistical credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the statistical loss estimates, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses estimation processes. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in the statistical credit loss estimates for the wholesale, credit card and consumer loan portfolios; testing the completeness and accuracy of data; and evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and judgments used in the statistical credit loss estimate and the adjustments to the statistical credit loss
estimates. This included, as relevant, evaluating the reasonableness of probabilities of default, loss severities and loss given default. Evaluating management’s adjustment to the statistical credit loss estimate included evaluating the reasonableness of the impacts of model imprecision and external factors and economic events which have occurred but are not yet otherwise reflected in the statistical credit loss estimate. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and inputs into the statistical credit loss estimates.

The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S. with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a discussion of the Firm’s business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.
Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as
the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant interest.
The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately- held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains such specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K
151

Notes to consolidated financial statements
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.
Revenue recognition
Interest income
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level- yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion of interest income.
Revenue from contracts with customers
JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers.
Principal transactions revenue
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.
152
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.
Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks.
Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the full remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.
The following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020:
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018
Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several accounting standards resulting in a net decrease of $183 million to retained earnings and a net increase of $88 million to AOCI. Certain of these standards were adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $505 million of fair value gains in the first quarter of 2018, recorded in total net revenue, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.
The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation process
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s VCG, which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. The VGF is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.
Price verification process
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:
154
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K
•
Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.
The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.
Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment.
•
•

Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.
• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 171 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.
Valuation hierarchy
A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.
• Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
• Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
• Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
    Classifications in the valuation Product/instrument Valuation methodology hierarchy
   Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider:
• Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below for further information.
• Market rates for the respective maturity
• Collateral characteristics Loans and lending-related commitments — wholesale

         Loans carried at fair value (e.g., trading loans and non- trading loans) and associated lending-related commitments
Loans — consumer
Trading loans — conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold
Investment and trading securities
Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on:
• Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent) • Relevant broker quotes
• Observed market prices for similar instruments
Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:
• Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating
• Prepayment speed
• Collateral characteristics
Fair value is based on observable prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity.
Quoted market prices
In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on:
• Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes
• Discounted cash flows
In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products:
Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs:
• Collateral characteristics
• Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
• Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity
Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs:
• Collateral characteristics
• Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
• Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity
• Credit spreads

   Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using the exchange price.
Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the contractual terms.
The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, commodity prices, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS spreads and recovery rates. Additionally, the credit quality of the counterparty and of the Firm as well as market funding levels may also be considered.
In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows:
Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include:
• CDS spreads and recovery rates
• Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments
Equity option specific inputs include: • Forward equity price
• Equity volatility
• Equity correlation
• Equity-FX correlation
• Equity-IR correlation
Interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include:
• Interest rate volatility
• Interest rate spread volatility • Interest rate correlation
• Foreign exchange correlation • Interest rate-FX correlation
Commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Commodity volatility
• Forward commodity price
Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 171 of this Note.
Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15.
Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include:
• Transaction prices
• Trading multiples of comparable public companies
• Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company
• Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not
identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific issues and lack of liquidity.
• Additional available inputs relevant to the investment.

• NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level.
• Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited.
Valued using observable market information, where available.
In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE.

• Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note.
• The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 171 of this Note.

                                (a) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $104.5 billion and $92.3 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.
(b) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, included within trading loans were $19.8 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and
$3.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated
with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $13.6 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
160 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.
(d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $684 million and $747 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were trading assets of $54 million and $49 million, respectively, and other assets of $630 million and $698 million, respectively.
(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 154–158 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.
In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.
For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at December 31, 2019, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity correlation, equity-FX and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward equity prices and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate volatility and interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated in the middle of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating the fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate inputs used in estimating the fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; conditional default rates and loss severity inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range and price inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range.

       (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSEs and government agency securities of $797 million, nonagency securities of $24 million and trading loans of $155 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $4 million and trading loans of $95 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant
unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-
based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.
The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions.
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/ or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.
Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the
underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument- specific factors.

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.
Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk- manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 0.6% of total Firm assets at December 31, 2019. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2018, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 172 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
For the year ended December 31, 2019
Level 3 assets were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $3.6 billion from December 31, 2018, partially due to a $1.4 billion decrease in MSRs. Refer to the Gains and losses section below for additional information.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with
each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 169 in this Note and Note 24 for further information.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

Of the $1.0 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2019, $787 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b) Primarily includes certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale.
(c) Of the $269 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2019, $248 million related to residential real
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 14% to 49% with a weighted average of 28%.
There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in other income.
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.
Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

  (a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan losses calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:
• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending- related commitments
• Certain securities financing agreements, such as those with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year
• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument
• Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of client-driven activities
• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election was made
The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined.
• Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.
•
•
Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market.
Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.

(b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $4.6 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(94) million and $(92) million, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 5 – Derivative instruments
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes.
Market-making derivatives
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.
Risk management derivatives
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.
Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the discussion in the Credit derivatives section on pages 191–194 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 191 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 188–191 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.
Derivative counterparties and settlement types
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.
Derivative clearing services
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain derivative exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services.
Accounting for derivatives
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 184–191 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Derivatives designated as hedges
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes.
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.
There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.
JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.
JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

     The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2019 and 2018, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

   In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.

(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
(f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(g) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

        (a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $14.9 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $2.8 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.
(d) Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance

         (a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains
and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.
(c) Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or
loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during 2017.
The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(8) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2019, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately five years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses

Foreign exchange derivatives $72 $64 $11 $1,219 $(152) $(1,244)
(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. The Firm reclassified net pre-tax gains/(losses) of $18 million to other income, $(17) million and $50 million to other expense related to the liquidation of certain legal entities during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Refer to Note 24 for further information.

           Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.
Credit derivatives
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Credit default swaps
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.
Credit-related notes
A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.
192
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.
Investment banking fees
This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.
The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction.
The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.
Principal transactions
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the
price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.
In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity
and foreign exchange risk;
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes,
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange
risk.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.
In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.
The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities in CIB and cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.

(a) Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts.
(b) Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption.
(c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided.
(d) Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue.
Asset management, administration and commissions are earned primarily by AWM, CIB, CCB, and CB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results.
Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category primarily reflects CCB’s Home Lending net production and net mortgage servicing revenue.
Net production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option.
      Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM. Refer to Note 32 for segment results.
Asset management, administration and commissions
This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services and other products. The Firm manages assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service providers are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense.
196
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.
Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and MSRs.
Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions, and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction- related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.
Certain Chase credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.
Credit card revenue sharing agreements
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co- brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co- brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years.
The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 7 – Interest income and Interest expense
Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability.
The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense:
Interest income and interest expense includes the current- period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 and 20, for further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to loans, investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term debt, respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement
employee benefit plans
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations.
The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified noncontributory plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. In connection with changes to the U.S. Retirement Savings Program during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Firm announced that it will freeze the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan Freeze”). Commencing on January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019 for new hires), new pay credits are directed to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Interest credits on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan will continue to accrue. As a result, a curtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension obligation and plan assets occurred as of November 30, 2018. The plan design change did not have a material impact on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Firm also has defined benefit pension plans that are offered in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this time making any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2020. The 2020 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $49 million, of which $34 million are contractually required.
The Firm also has a number of nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that are unfunded. These plans provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain employees.
The Firm offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. retirees and postretirement medical benefits to certain qualifying U.S. and U.K. employees.
The Firm partially defrays the cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation through corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, certain COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The Firm has prefunded its U.S. postretirement benefit obligations. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded.
Pension and OPEB accounting guidance generally requires that the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation be measured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans that are overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit obligation) are recorded in other assets and plans that are underfunded (excess benefit obligation over plan assets) are recorded in other liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the value of plan assets are recorded in OCI and recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods as discussed in the Gains and losses section of this Note. Additionally, benefits earned during the year are reported in compensation expense; all other components of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income.

Gains and losses
For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently eight years and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. As a result of the Plan Freeze, beginning in 2020, any excess for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan will be amortized over the average expected lifetime of plan participants which is currently 38 years. In addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized.
For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. This value is referred to as the market-related value of assets. Amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted for gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets. Any excess is amortized over the average expected lifetime of retired participants, which is currently eleven years.

Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return for defined benefit pension and OPEB plan assets is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short-term portfolio mix of each plan.
The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans was provided by the Firm’s actuaries. This rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. The discount rate for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan represents a rate of appropriate duration from the analysis of yield curves provided by the Firm’s actuaries.
At December 31, 2019, the Firm decreased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the U.S.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

defined benefit pension and OPEB plans in light of current market interest rates, which is expected to decrease expense by approximately $69 million in 2020. The 2020 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets and U.S. OPEB plan assets are 4.00% and 4.11%, respectively.
The following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the two listed rates below on estimated 2020 defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense, as well as the effect on the postretirement benefit obligations.
Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The trust- owned assets of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested primarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to partially defray the cost of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices.
The investment policies for the assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of each plan using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary.
Investments held by the plans include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Additionally, the investments in each of the collective investment funds and/or registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. As of December 31, 2019, assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in ETFs, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2019, 2018 and 2017, JPMorgan Chase granted long- term share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2019, 75 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2022. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans.
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three- year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.
Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. There were no material grants of employee SARs or stock options in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
206
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

RSUs, PSUs, employee SARs and stock options activity
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, employee SARs and stock options activity for 2019.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At December 31, 2019, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings). The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as
net increases or decreases to AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM debt securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM debt securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm transferred $6.2 billion of collateralized loan obligations from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. These securities were transferred at fair value in a non-cash transaction.

                    AFS and HTM debt securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of the Firm’s ongoing assessment of OTTI. The Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than- temporary when the Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.
For AFS debt securities, the Firm recognizes OTTI losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities.
For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI.
Factors considered in evaluating potential OTTI include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating
agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and the Firm’s intent and ability to hold the security until recovery.
The Firm’s cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period. When assessing securities issued in a securitization for OTTI, the Firm estimates cash flows considering underlying loan- level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. The Firm also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios.
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm considers an impairment to be other- than-temporary when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
The Firm recognizes unrealized losses on investment securities that it intends to sell as OTTI. The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2019, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Further, the Firm did not recognize any credit-related OTTI losses during the year ended December 31, 2019. Based on its assessment, the Firm believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2019, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.

          (a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash.
Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.
Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.
As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above, the Firm did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:
• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value
• PCI loans held-for-investment
The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories:
Loans held-for-investment (other than PCI loans)
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.
Nonaccrual loans
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.
On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the
carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. The Firm separately establishes an allowance, which reduces loans and is charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income on credit card loans.
Allowance for loan losses
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the recorded investment to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.
Charge-offs
Consumer loans, other than risk-rated business banking and auto loans, and PCI loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans and non-modified credit card loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due.
Certain consumer loans will be charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge- off standards in certain circumstances as follows:
• Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.
• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).
• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.
Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on government- guaranteed loans.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K
217

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Wholesale loans, risk-rated business banking loans and risk- rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impaired and collateral- dependent. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral.
When a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every twelve months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- specific factors.
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.
Loans held-for-sale
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge- off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.
Loans at fair value
Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.
Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.
Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.
Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.
PCI loans
PCI loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. PCI loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loan’s origination date and therefore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Because PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans is recorded at the acquisition date. Refer to page 229 of this Note for information on accounting for PCI loans subsequent to their acquisition.
218
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Loan classification changes
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.
In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.
Loan modifications
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments.
Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms. In certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or above the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. In such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and the Firm expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impaired and as a TDR only during the year of the modification; in subsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as an impaired loan or as a TDR so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured.
Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.
Because loans modified in TDRs are considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status and/or the loan has been removed from the impaired loans disclosures (i.e., loans restructured at market rates). Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance.
Foreclosed property
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.
The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.
Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:

For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660 ) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.
For scored auto and scored business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.
Risk-rated business banking and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primary credit quality indicators are the internal risk ratings that are assigned to the loan and whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. Refer to page 234 of this Note for further information about risk-rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators.

       (a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: days past due included $20 million and $2.1 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $26 million and respectively.
current included $17 million and $2.8 billion; 30–149 $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018,
(b) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $46 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(c) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, these balances included $34 million and $999 million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
(d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(f) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2019.
(g) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $63 million and $6.9 billion, respectively. These amounts have
been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table provides the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

     (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.
(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty.
HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.
Impaired loans
The table below provides information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13.

          (a) Represents collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2019, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 9% of residential mortgages and approximately 7% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due.
(b) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $14 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.
(c) Predominantly all impaired loans in the table above are in the U.S.
(d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan
balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.
(e) As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, nonaccrual loans included $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than
90 days past due. Refer to the Loan accounting framework on pages 217–219 of this Note for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

        The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSEs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.
The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented.

      (a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for residential mortgage and 8 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).
Active and suspended foreclosure
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $529 million and $653 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

Loan modifications
Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. At
December 31, 2019 and 2018, other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $76 million and $79 million, respectively. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $54 million and $57 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 (a) When discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S.
(c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $246 million, $275 million and $427 million for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
(d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.

Purchased credit-impaired loans
PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value at acquisition. PCI loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. All of the Firm’s residential real estate PCI loans were acquired in the same fiscal quarter and aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.
On a quarterly basis, the Firm estimates the total cash flows (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. These estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related forgone interest cash flows, discounted at the pool’s effective interest rate. Impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are generally recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.
The Firm continues to modify certain PCI loans. The impact of these modifications is incorporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans. In evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows, the Firm incorporates the effect of any forgone interest and also considers the potential for redefault. The Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified PCI loans.
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not reported on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans.
Since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for the Firm’s PCI consumer loan pools are reasonably estimable, interest is being accreted and the loan pools are being reported as performing loans. No interest would be accreted and the PCI loan pools would be reported as nonaccrual loans if the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on the loan pools were determined not to be reasonably estimable.
The liquidation of PCI loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payment in full from the borrower, or foreclosure, results in removal of the loans from the underlying PCI pool. When the amount of the liquidation proceeds (e.g., cash, real estate), if any, is less than the unpaid principal balance of the loan, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool’s nonaccretable difference for principal losses (i.e., the lifetime credit loss estimate established as a purchase accounting adjustment at the acquisition date). When the nonaccretable difference for a particular loan pool has been fully depleted, any excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loan over the liquidation proceeds is written off against the PCI pool’s allowance for loan losses. Write-offs of PCI loans also include other adjustments, primarily related to principal forgiveness modifications. Because the Firm’s PCI loans are accounted for at a pool level, the Firm does not recognize charge-offs of PCI loans when they reach specified stages of delinquency (i.e., unlike non-PCI consumer loans, these loans are not charged off based on FFIEC standards).
The PCI portfolio affects the Firm’s results of operations primarily through: (i) contribution to net interest margin; (ii) expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii) any provision for loan losses.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.
The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.

Credit card impaired loans and loan modifications
The table below provides information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.
New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, were $961 million, $866 million and $756 million, respectively. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.

 The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs.

(a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.
For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 32.89%, 33.38% and 31.54% as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.
Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.
Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio for the periods indicated, which consists primarily of secured commercial loans, of which multifamily is the largest segment. Multifamily lending finances acquisition, leasing and construction of apartment buildings, and includes loans to real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). Other commercial lending largely includes financing for acquisition, leasing and construction, largely for office, retail and industrial real estate, and includes loans to REITs. Included in real estate loans is $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of construction and development loans originally purposed for construction and development, general purpose loans for builders, as well as loans for land subdivision and pre- development.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolio, which consists of the two consumer portfolio segments (primarily scored) and the wholesale portfolio segment (risk-rated). The allowance for loan losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans, as described below. Management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending- related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans.
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for credit losses are described in the following paragraphs.
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.
Formula-based component
The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for incurred credit losses in all consumer loans and performing risk-rated loans. All loans restructured in TDRs as well as any impaired risk-rated loans have an allowance assessed as part of the asset- specific component, while PCI loans have an allowance assessed as part of the PCI component. Refer to Note 12 for more information on TDRs, Impaired loans and PCI loans.
Formula-based component - Consumer loans and certain lending-related commitments
The formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and loss severities) to the recorded investment balances or loan- equivalent amounts of pools of loan exposures with similar risk characteristics over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. In addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Management uses additional statistical methods and considers actual portfolio performance, including actual losses recognized on defaulted loans and collateral valuation trends, to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate. The economic impact of
potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation because of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications.
The statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer credit portfolio.
Overall, the allowance for credit losses for consumer portfolios is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. While all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in another. In addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Formula-based component - Wholesale loans and lending- related commitments
The Firm’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. The formula-based component of the allowance for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the recorded investment balances or loan-equivalent over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by the funded versus unfunded status of the instrument and may change over time.
The Firm assesses the credit quality of a borrower or counterparty and assigns an internal risk rating. Risk ratings are assigned at origination or acquisition, and if necessary, adjusted for changes in credit quality over the life of the exposure. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan or lending-related commitment, among the factors considered are the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Determining risk ratings involves significant judgment; emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by the Firm.
A PD estimate is determined based on the Firm’s history of defaults over more than one credit cycle.
LGD estimate is a judgment-based estimate assigned to each loan or lending-related commitment. The estimate represents the amount of economic loss if the obligor were to default. The type of obligor, quality of collateral, and the seniority of the Firm’s lending exposure in the obligor’s capital structure affect LGD.
The Firm applies judgment in estimating PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used in calculating the allowance for credit losses. Estimates of PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Changes to the time period used for PD and LGD estimates could also affect the allowance for credit losses. The use of different inputs, estimates or methodologies could change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the Firm.
In addition to the statistical credit loss estimates applied to the wholesale portfolio, management applies its judgment to adjust the statistical estimates for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss
factors. Historical experience of both LGD and PD are considered when estimating these adjustments. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. These estimates are based on management’s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic conditions, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio.
Asset-specific component
The asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in TDRs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger risk-rated loans (primarily loans in the wholesale portfolio segment) are evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both risk- rated and scored) are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets.
The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan’s fair value. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. For any of these impaired loans, the amount of the asset-specific allowance required to be recorded, if any, is dependent upon the recorded investment in the loan (including prior charge-offs), and either the expected cash flows or fair value of collateral. Refer to Note 12 for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans.
The asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in TDRs (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions) incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors, including the level of future home prices. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.
PCI loans
In connection with the acquisition of certain PCI loans, which are accounted for as described in Note 12, the allowance for loan losses for the PCI portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans.
These cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home prices, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. These estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

The Firm considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

 The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:
• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
• Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third- party transaction.
• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 247 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.
The Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb
losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors.
The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm- sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $5.3 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 50% and 37% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Firm did
242
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

not retain any senior securities and retained $3.0 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests. Refer to Securitization activity on page 248 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows associated with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 248– 249 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies.

The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion of investment-grade, and $72 million and $16 million of noninvestment-grade at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $1.2 billion of investment-grade for both periods, and $575 million and $623 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.
In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. Refer to the table on page 246 of this Note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations.
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Refer to the table on page 246 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Refer to the table on page 246 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re- securitization VIEs during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and retained interests in any such Firm- sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re- securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

The following table presents information on nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $16.3 billion and $20.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $8.9 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to page 247 of this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non- customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2019 and 2018.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to

  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re- securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re- securitization VIEs.
Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer to page 246 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.
Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities
Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.
Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $19.1 billion and $16.5 billion, of which $5.5 billion and $4.0 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $5.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8.6 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending- related commitments.
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government- sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization- related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the Firm’s Operating Committee. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.
Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. In the first step, the current fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then a second step is performed. In the second step, the implied current fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. The resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. If the carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied current fair value, then no goodwill impairment is recognized.
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed periodically and updated as needed.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness.
The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.
Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K
251

Notes to consolidated financial statements
The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e.,
those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 16 – Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated useful life of the leased asset.
JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

Effective January 1, 2019, the Firm adopted new guidance that requires lessees to recognize on the Consolidated balance sheets all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. Accordingly, the Firm recognized operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of $8.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. The adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. The change in accounting due to the adoption of the new lease guidance did not result in a material change to the future net minimum rental payments/receivables or to the net rental expense when compared to December 31, 2018.
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.

Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The following tables provide information related to the Firm’s operating leases:
Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. Generally, the Firm’s lease financings are operating leases. These assets are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income.
On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.
The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.

                           (a) The interest rates shown are the range of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. Including the effects of the hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at December 31, 2019, for total long-term debt was (0.02)% to 9.43%, versus the contractual range of 0.15% to 9.43% presented in the table above. The interest rate ranges shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.
(b) Included long-term debt of $32.0 billion and $47.7 billion secured by assets totaling $186.1 billion and $207.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments.
(c) Included $75.7 billion and $54.9 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(d) Included $13.6 billion and $11.2 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate principal amount
of these notes at their respective maturities is $39.3 billion and $37.4 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.
(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $36 million and $28 million accounted for at
fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $11.1 billion
and $6.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(f) At December 31, 2019, long-term debt in the aggregate of $141.3 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to
maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.
(g) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2019 is $38.3 billion in 2020, $45.8 billion in 2021, $19.6
billion in 2022, $29.7 billion in 2023 and $25.9 billion in 2024.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.13% and 3.28% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 3.19% and 3.64% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $14.4 billion and $10.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

The Firm from time to time enters into written trading plans
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “blackout periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, on page 30 for additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 70.5 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.
                There were no warrants to purchase shares of common stock (“Warrants”) outstanding at December 31, 2019, as any Warrants that were not exercised on or before October 29, 2018, have expired. At December 31, 2017, the Firm had 15.0 million Warrants outstanding.
On June 27, 2019, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s release of its 2019 CCAR results, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized a $29.4 billion common equity repurchase program. As of December 31, 2019, $15.6 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s share- based compensation plans.

Management’s discussion and analysis Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Note 25 – Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.
Effective tax rate and expense
The following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.
Impact of the TCJA
2018
The Firm’s effective tax rate decreased in 2018 due to the TCJA, including the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as well as a $302 million net tax benefit recorded in 2018 resulting from changes in the estimates related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. The change in estimate was recorded under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) and the accounting under SAB 118 is complete.
2017
The Firm’s effective tax rate increased in 2017 driven by a $1.9 billion income tax expense representing the estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA. The $1.9 billion tax expense was predominantly driven by a deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings and adjustments to the value of certain tax-oriented investments partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of the Firm’s net deferred tax liability.
The deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits of each controlled foreign corporation. The calculation resulted in an estimated income tax expense of $3.7 billion. Furthermore, accounting for income taxes requires the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The Firm remeasured its deferred tax asset and liability balances in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the new statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% as well as any federal benefit associated with state and local deferred income taxes. The remeasurement resulted in an estimated income tax benefit of $2.1 billion.
Adjustments were also recorded in 2017 to income tax expense for certain tax-oriented investments. These adjustments were driven by changes to affordable housing proportional amortization resulting from the reduction of the federal income tax rate under the TCJA. SAB 118 did not apply to these adjustments.

265

The following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income.
Prior to December 31, 2017, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings had been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. The Firm is no longer maintaining the indefinite reinvestment assertion on the undistributed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries in light of the enactment of the TCJA. The U.S. federal and state and local income taxes associated with the undistributed and previously untaxed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries was included in the deemed repatriation charge recorded as of December 31, 2017. The Firm will recognize any taxes it may incur on global intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred.
Affordable housing tax credits
The Firm recognized $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $8.6 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Deferred taxes
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.
Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $4.0 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of which $2.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as $0.5 billion. Upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result from payment or income statement recognition.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

       JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $605 million at December 31, 2019, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards, foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards, and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2019, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were $1.0 billion, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $80 million, FTC carryforwards were $329 million, and state and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.1 billion. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire between 2022 and 2036 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire in 2029 and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire between 2020 and 2022.
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2019, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted
assets and intercompany funds transfers
Restricted cash and other restricted assets
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits.
The Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average required amount of reserve balances is deposited by the Firm’s bank subsidiaries. In addition, the Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks.
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealers (principally J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in the U.S and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the U.K.) are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets.
The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash:
Intercompany funds transfers
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk- based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors.
At January 1, 2020, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $9 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2020 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 27 – Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the fully phased-in measures under Basel III that represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis.
The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:
The following table presents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2019.

 Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.
To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Guarantees
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.
As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For certain
types of guarantees, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. For indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). Any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is recognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable. The contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 273. For additional information on the guarantees, see below.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Securities lending indemnifications
Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.
The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.
The notional value of derivatives guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.
Unsettled securities financing agreements
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
Mortgage repurchase liability
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expenses.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.
Loans sold with recourse
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $944 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $27 million and $30 million at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Other off-balance sheet arrangements
Indemnification agreements – general
In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.
Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge- backs.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of $1,511.5 billion, $1,366.1 billion, and $1,191.7 billion, respectively, and the related losses from merchant charge- backs were not material.
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.
As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member.
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
276
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.
Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Exchange & Clearing House Memberships
The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 273, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line.
Sponsored member repo program
In 2018 the Firm commenced the sponsored member repo program, wherein the Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 273. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.
Guarantees of subsidiaries
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 273 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies
As of December 31, 2019, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:
• the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,
• the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,
• the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and
• the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and no trial date has been set.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. In addition, the Firm has paid fines totaling approximately $265 million in connection with the settlement of FX-related investigations conducted by the European Commission and the Swiss Competition Commission which were announced in May 2019 and June 2019, respectively. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the District Court. In addition, some FX- related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants filed notices of appeal of the District Court’s approval order. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the
settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.
In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 280
various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These actions are in various stages of litigation.
In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and certain of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending.
Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct. The Firm also is responding to
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

related requests concerning similar trading-practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasuries. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations and is currently engaged in discussions with various regulators about resolving their respective investigations. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in settlements. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act.
Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.
***
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was $239 million, $72 million and $(35) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Notes to consolidated financial statements Note 31 – International operations
The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses.
2019
As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Business segment capital allocation
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and payables that are currently presented as a single margin account on the balance sheet. In addition, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments and structured notes from interest-earning/ bearing to noninterest-earning/bearing assets and liabilities as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.
(b) Represents securities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
(c) Includes prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables, which are classified in accrued interest and accounts receivable, and all other interest-
earning assets, which are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(d) Includes commercial paper.
(e) All other interest-bearing liabilities include prime brokerage-related customer payables.

Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis
The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 288–292 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

• All wholesale nonaccrual loans
• All TDRs (both wholesale and consumer), including ones that have returned to accrual status

Loss emergence period: Represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss.
LTIP: Long-term incentive plan
LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination
date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.
Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.
Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).

MBS: Mortgage-backed securities
MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis
Merchant Services: is a business that primarily processes transactions for merchants.

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms Mortgage product types:
Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.
MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas MSR: Mortgage servicing rights
Multi-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class.
NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.
NAV: Net Asset Value 296
Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge- offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.
Net interchange income includes the following components:
• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions.
• Reward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs.
• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.
Net mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.
Net production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option.
Net revenue rate: Represents Card Services net revenue (annualized) expressed as a percentage of average loans for the period.
Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.
NM: Not meaningful NOL: Net operating loss
Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives:
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.
Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.
PCA: Prompt corrective action
PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics(e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.
PD: Probability of default
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
Pretax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which management evaluates the performance of AWM against the performance of their respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.
In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity
and foreign exchange risk;
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes,
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk.

RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Risk-rated portfolio: Credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default (“PD”) and loss severity given a default.

ROA: Return on assets
ROE: Return on equity
ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity ROU assets: Right-of-use assets
RSU(s): Restricted stock units
RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.
S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 Index SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights
Scored portfolio: The scored portfolio predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans and certain auto and business banking loans where credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time.

Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.
Shelf Deals: Shelf offerings are SEC provisions that allow issuers to register for new securities without selling the entire issuance at once. Since these issuances are filed with the SEC but are not yet priced in the market, they are not included in the league tables until the actual securities are issued.
Single-name: Single reference-entities
SLR: Supplementary leverage ratio
SMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate SPEs: Special purpose entities
Structural interest rate risk: Represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.
Structured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes.
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax- equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in managed basis results on a level comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
TBVPS: Tangible book value per share TCE: Tangible common equity
