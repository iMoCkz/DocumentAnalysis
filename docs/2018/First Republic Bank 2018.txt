  It’s a privilege to serve you.

 2018 was the most successful year ever for First Republic. Loans, deposits and wealth management all experienced robust growth. Total earnings grew very nicely, up 12.7%. Tangible book value per share increased 11.9% and credit quality remains excellent.
We were very pleased that First Republic was added to the S&P 500 Index at year-end.
SIMPLE BUSINESS MODEL
The source of our success continues to be our unique culture, which is focused on the daily execution of a long-term oriented, high-touch, client-centric service model. First Republic has evolved into an exceptionally strong service brand whose organic, sustainable growth is propelled by the passion and loyalty of our satisfied clients.
THE POWER OF CLIENT SERVICE
We focus on extraordinary client service, which we measure continually through our Net Promoter Score. Client service, which leads to unusually low client attrition as well as strong referrals, is the source of our safe, organic growth. Our most recent Net Promoter Scores continue to be more than double the U.S. banking industry and even above most luxury service brands.
CONSISTENT PROFITABILITY
First Republic has been consistently profitable each year since our 1985 inception. Our straight- forward business model has performed exceedingly well, over almost three and a half decades, through widely varying economic and geopolitical conditions.
EMPOWERED AND ENGAGED COLLEAGUES
Success starts with exceptional people operating within a client-centric culture that empowers colleagues to meet clients’ needs. We attract and retain high-performing, engaged individuals who have an unwavering commitment to extraordinary client service. First Republic is committed to taking very good care of our people, through continual professional development programs alongside competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits. 36% of our workforce par-

ticipates in our Gradifi Student Loan PayDown and College SaveUp programs, 51% in our discounted employee stock purchase program, and 98% in our 401(k) matching program.
INCLUSIVE CULTURE AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE
First Republic is also committed to continuing to foster an inclusive workplace culture, which embraces and encourages diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Our diverse workforce is 48% minority and 47% female, and speaks over 50 languages. This diversity is longstanding and extends across all levels of the organization, with a senior management team composed of 48% female leaders, including our President.
EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE DRIVES OUR GROWTH
Taking outstanding care of our existing clients is the key source of our safe, sustainable growth. More than 50% of our annual growth each year involves doing more business with existing clients, and another 25% comes from direct referrals by these same, highly satisfied clients — both are proven, safe and stable growth channels. We experience only very modest client attrition each year. This compounding network effect of low attrition and strong referrals is immensely powerful and quite unique in today’s banking environment.
LEADERSHIP DEPTH AND BREADTH
We are founder-led with an extensive and experienced leadership team. Our stable, experienced and diverse senior team has a deep expertise and knowledge of our industry, markets, business model and, most importantly, culture. The considerable diversity of First Republic’s leadership and workforce has been a key to our success for several decades.
STRONG AND GROWING CAPITAL
We remain well-capitalized and successfully accessed the capital markets twice during 2018. We raised over $490 million of new equity capital while redeeming both our 5.625% Series C and 7.00% Series E preferred stock, totaling $350 million. Over the last five years, our total Tier 1

EXCEPTIONAL CREDIT QUALITY
Credit is a core First Republic focus and remains strong, with only $3.0 million in loan losses during 2018, or less than one basis point of average loans, and non-performing assets of only five basis points of total assets at year-end.
2018 PERFORMANCE
In 2018, we experienced our strongest results yet: • Revenues were up 16.6% to $3.0 billion
• Net income was up 12.7% to $853.8 million
• Earnings per share were up 11.6% to $4.81
• Tangible book value per share was up 11.9% to $45.26
Loan originations totaled $32.1 billion — our best year ever. Growth in loans outstanding was 20.7%, funded primarily by strong deposit growth and supported by capital growth.
Deposits were up 14.7%. Successful growth was generated across all of our channels — private banking, banking offices, business banking and wealth management. Checking remains a strong 60% of total deposits at year-end.
BUSINESS BANKING
Business Banking had a very good year. Both business loans and deposits grew nicely. At year-end, business loans outstanding totaled $11.0 billion, up 32.6% year over year, and represented 15% of total loans. Business deposits grew by 18.4% and represented 56% of total deposits at year-end.
PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Private Wealth Management had another strong year, with total assets under management or administration up 18.0% to $126.2 billion in spite of difficult market conditions. Additionally,

 we transacted over $33 billion of foreign exchange and placed $1.4 billion in face value of insurance on behalf of our clients in 2018, up 68% and 107% respectively over 2017.
Total fee revenues from wealth management were up 21.7% and now represent 14.2% of total revenues, compared to only 10.0% just five years ago.
NEXT-GENERATION STRATEGY
Our Student Loan Refinancing, First Home Program and Professional Loan Program households grew 55% during the year, with total loan originations of $1.7 billion. Such next-generation clients, who are generally younger, now represent fully 37% of First Republic’s total consumer borrowing households, compared to only 14% three years ago — an increase of more than 2.5 times. This strong trend has transformational implications for First Republic.
CLIENT HOUSEHOLD GROWTH
A key measure we watch carefully, total client household growth, is being favorably impacted by our next-generation programs and was exceptionally strong in 2018. During the 2010–2014 period, our new borrowing household growth rate was 15% per year. For the three-year period 2015–2018, it was 23% per year, a more than 50% increase. This change provides First Republic a rapidly expanding and diversified client base.
GRADIFI
In 2018, Gradifi successfully introduced its College SaveUp program, as well as its new Gradifi Refi program, which enables employers across the country to offer attractive student loan refi- nancing programs to their employees. Gradifi grew during the year to serve over 600 corporate clients by year-end.

Our Community Advisory Board is enhancing our already strong fair lending and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) programs. And our Eagle Community Loan Program continues to help more individuals in our communities become homeowners.

L. MARTIN GIBBS
Before closing this year’s letter, we would like to acknowledge and thank Marty Gibbs, who
is retiring after 34 years of extraordinary service as a key Board Member. We want to express our profound gratitude to Marty for his insightful and dedicated service to First Republic as a Director since our founding. In fact, Marty, as our outside legal counsel at the time, was the sole original incorporator of First Republic — in February 1985. He has contributed immeasurably to the strategy, integrity, growth and success of First Republic for over three decades and remains a great friend of the Bank.
SUMMARY
2018 was a volatile year with respect to both the interest rate and investment markets. Despite the challenging environment, First Republic produced our best results ever. Our growth comes directly from happy clients who continually do more with us and actively refer their friends. The power of this simple, client-centric service model coupled with our conservative risk management approach allows us to provide stable results in a wide range of economic conditions. A stable, sustainable growth model — intensely executed every day.
Without our wonderful communities of clients, shareholders and dedicated colleagues, First Republic would not succeed. We truly thank each of you for your continued business, ongoing support and hard work.
It’s a privilege to serve you,

Since she and her husband, Theo, bought their first home with the Bank in 1999, the relationship has evolved into a dynamic partnership that includes financial guidance on personal and business matters (and early-stage prod- uct testing with their neighborhood banking team). As the couple continues to grow the hint, Inc., brand and share healthy choices with consumers, First Republic is ready to meet their evolving needs.

   Bentley School
Client Since 2005
Bentley School has a nearly century-long legacy of excellence in education — a distinction earned through the dedication and passion of teachers and staff. The School must ensure that these educators, its most important resource, receive the same high level of support that students do. To that end, working with Gradifi, a First Republic company, to help alleviate the burden of student loan debt for teachers and staff members was a powerful step. Bentley School cares for each individual student and teacher in the same way that the Bank values its clients. This compatibility is the foundation of the longstanding relationship between Bentley School and First Republic.
Bentley School is proud to offer an education debt refinance and repayment benefits program through Gradifi.

Clients Since 2003
Before their recent move to Wyoming, John and May Herr raised their four children in California’s Silicon Valley. While out with the kids one Saturday morning back in 2003, John discovered the First Republic office in Palo Alto. The family was so impressed by the warm welcome they received that the visit turned into a weekend ritual — and the kids now associate banking with warm cookies and friendly conversations. As the Herrs’ needs evolved, their relationship with the Bank expanded naturally. And when the Bank opened its new office in Jackson, the family was there on opening day, delighted to welcome a familiar neighbor to their new hometown.

   “The First Republic team has supported me from day one — helping me buy my first home and save along the way.”
Dalila Ramos Alvarado, Early Childhood Educator
 Dalila Ramos Alvarado
Client Since 2014
When Dalila Ramos Alvarado got the keys to her condo, she took in the city sounds and lights and thought, “I’m home.” She’d diligently saved for the down payment, focusing on her priorities: raising her young son in a stable, comfortable home while continuing her career as an educator in the city she loves, Los Angeles. First Republic guided her through the homebuying process, identifying a grant that would make her ideal home an affordable reality. That support continued after she moved in. Dalila’s personal banker called about an opportunity to refinance her mortgage at an even lower rate, enabling her to spend more time with her son and save for his future.

   Chinatown Health Clinic Foundation
Client Since 2014
The Chinatown Health Clinic Foundation (CHCF) supports the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, a nonprofit that’s been improving access to quality health services for underserved populations since 1971. Thanks to CHCF and the tireless dedication of a few individuals, what began as a volunteer effort in a church basement has grown to be the neighborhood’s largest provider of healthcare. In 2014, CHCF found a natural fit with First Republic, a bank that has decades of experience supporting mission-driven nonprofits. Most recently, First Republic refinanced CHCF’s commercial loan, helping to free up enough capital to fund the opening of another health center site and further extend quality care to the community.

After years of renting (and saving) in San Francisco, Mike Johnston and Nicole Mirchandani were ready to find a place they could call their own. Envisioning backyard barbecues and family dinners, the newlyweds were seeking ample space, a chef ’s kitchen and, of course, a relatively easy Bay Area commute. Their search was full of ups and downs. But when they found First Republic, they gained a responsive, experienced team who understood their finances and the competitive market. The couple landed in a home that checks all the right boxes, with a new financial ally to support them into the future.
