2018 — East West Bancorp Annual Report
 A Message from Our Chairman, President and CEO
Dominic Ng
Dear Shareholders,
On February 11, 2019, I was joined
by our board of directors and senior management to ring the Nasdaq opening bell in celebration of East West’s 20th anniversary as a publicly traded company. I am proud of the milestones and growth that East West achieved throughout its history. We have
a long, well-established track record of strong financial performance. But more meaningfully, as our customers have grown in size and complexity, so has our banking expertise. This evolution of our capabilities enabled us to grow and succeed alongside our customers.
 3

East West was founded in 1973 as a savings and loan association with one branch in Chinatown, Los Angeles. Our mission was to provide access
to banking to the Chinese-American community, whose needs were not
being met by mainstream banks. Offering checking and savings accounts, auto loans and home mortgages, we served as a bridge for immigrants to integrate and prosper in America. Highly entrepreneurial, many of our customers started family-owned businesses that they grew with the help of small business loans from East West. We converted
our charter into a commercial bank in 1995, to keep pace with our customers’ increasing commercial banking needs.
Our vision to be the bridge between the East and the West was fundamental to our founding, and has evolved over the years.
Over time, as many of our customers started businesses that imported or exported goods between the U.S. and Greater China, our capabilities broadened to provide international trade financing and currency exchange for remittances. Establishing a presence in China was
the next step in serving as the financial bridge between the East and the West
for our customers. Our first entry into Greater China was in 2003, through a representative office in Beijing. This was followed by the opening of our first branch in Hong Kong in 2007, and the addition
of a local currency commercial banking license in China in 2009. Our Greater China presence now comprises five branches and five representative offices in cities key for cross-border commerce.
The increase in bilateral foreign direct investment between the U.S. and China created new and different business opportunities for our customers – and East West – to pursue. Accordingly, based on our assessment of which sectors would offer the greatest scope for commercial growth between the two economies, we built expertise in industry verticals such as entertainment, private equity, and technology.
As our customers’ businesses expanded domestically and internationally, so did their banking requirements. To help our customers manage market volatility, we added interest rate, foreign currency
and commodity risk hedging. To service the business operating accounts of our customers, we elevated the capabilities
of our cash management products. Whether to invest in or start a company, build manufacturing facilities, or diversify supply chains – we have the products and services to meet our customers’ needs.
From our roots as a bank for immigrants, we have grown to serve a diverse customer base in the United States and in Greater China. Our customers reflect the successive waves of Chinese immigration to the United States, the profile of which now includes multinational corporations and global citizens. Over the years, as
we grew in size to a regional bank, our customer base broadened beyond the Chinese-American community to reflect the demographics of the geographic markets that we serve.
Today, our vision to be the bridge between the East and the West means providing a seamless banking experience for customers on both sides of the Pacific, with a comprehensive suite of lending, deposit, and fee-based products and services.

Unique among U.S.-based regional banks, we have a presence in Greater China and capabilities to provide cross- border banking solutions between the U.S. and China.
Our dedicated cross-border team of experienced bankers in the U.S. and Greater China works together with primary relationship managers to identify the cross-border needs of each client and craft customized solutions. Beyond banking, we bring to the table an extensive understanding of the local business environment, regulations and culture essential for our customers’ success in both countries. By identifying partners, investors and resources
for our customers, we broaden their opportunities, helping them enter new markets or expand existing operations.
In our view, the two-way flow of capital between the U.S. and China is inevitable. We do not see the two largest economies in the world decoupling. Therefore, we are confident that our distinctive bridge banking positioning will support our business growth, differentiating us com- petitively from other banks. Geopolitical uncertainty creates opportunities for us to reinforce the value we provide to our customers and deepen our relationships. Now more than ever, our clients need us to interpret a changing environment and provide banking support to adapt to and take advantage of circumstances offered by market disruption.
East West’s value proposition applies
to personal banking needs, too. Our appreciation for multicultural consumers
is reflected in the products that we offer, and in the investments that we are making for the future. A major initiative for us is developing a digital consumer banking platform tailored to the unique needs of customers that have family, homes and wealth in both the U.S. and in Greater China.
Celebrating 20 Years of Public Listing
The artwork featured on the cover of this report is Peony in Full Bloom by
Cai Guo-Qiang. The peony traditionally symbolizes prosperity and good fortune in the Chinese culture. We consider it an auspicious symbol to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a public company.
By publicly listing on Nasdaq in 1999,
we gained greater access to capital to support the growth of our balance sheet, organically and through acquisitions. Compared to when we went public, our assets have grown 20 times, from $2.1 billion to $41.0 billion. Our footprint expanded from California to seven states across the U.S., covering some of the most dynamic metropolitan areas in the country, and to Greater China. The size of our workforce increased from 370 to 3,200 employees.
In the past 20 years, we completed 11 bank acquisitions including, most notably, the acquisition of United Commercial Bank in 2009, which nearly doubled our asset size at the time from $12.5 billion to $20.6 billion. When we went public, our market capitalization was just $229 million. On the 20th anniversary of our listing, our market capitalization was
$7.5 billion. Today, we are one of the 25 largest banks in the United States by both market capitalization and asset size.

In Conclusion
Peony in Full Bloom was created by
Cai Guo-Qiang, a singular force in the international art world today. Born in China, Cai now lives in New York. He is truly a global citizen and through his art, a bridge between the East and the West. Cai is renowned for the use of gunpowder in his art, a Chinese invention that is more than 1,000 years old. To me, the path
of his success is a parallel to the path of many Chinese immigrants, whose success both in the U.S. and internationally bridges cultures and markets. At East West, we are proud to serve as the bridge for their financial needs.
I am honored to lead such a high- performing bank with associates that go above and beyond in helping our customers achieve their goals.

Relationship-centric banking is at the heart of East West’s approach, and the longevity of our customer relationships is a testament to its success. In this report, we highlight three customers that have banked with us since before our public listing, who have built thriving businesses that benefit their communities through their growth.
On behalf of East West, I would like to thank all of our customers for their business, our shareholders for their confidence, and our 3,200 associates for their extraordinary efforts.
As we celebrate our 20th anniversary as a public institution and reflect on how far we have come, we look forward to another 20 years of success.

Downtown Properties
 Downtown Properties is a Los Angeles- based real estate investment company that is affiliated with Gaw Capital
Partners, a real estate private equity
group with over $18 billion of assets under management. Downtown Properties’ first project was the revitalization of the iconic Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. It was at the Roosevelt that the first Academy Awards ceremony took place. Goodwin Gaw, the founder of Downtown Properties and
Gaw Capital, purchased the then-derelict Roosevelt in 1995 and turned it into one of the hottest spots in Los Angeles, a place to see and be seen, restoring the landmark hotel to its glamour.
The Roosevelt provided Downtown Properties with a blueprint for many other successful projects: renovating distressed heritage properties, taking care to preserve their historical importance. Notably, Downtown Properties was one of the pioneers in rehabilitating downtown Los Angeles
by acquiring many neglected buildings with architectural significance and transforming them into trendy places to live, work and dine. Currently, Downtown Properties is converting The MacArthur,
a historic, Art Deco building in Los Angeles, into a boutique hotel and stylish entertainment destination.
Today, Downtown Properties owns and manages a portfolio of 15 acclaimed properties across the U.S.
2018 — East West Bancorp Annual Report
 Ever since East West helped us finance the acquisition of the Roosevelt Hotel, a mutual trust was established. When working with the East West team, processes are streamlined and layers eliminated. Therefore, we are able to act with speed and urgency, a key component to success in our line of business.

East West Promotes Affordable Housing
 Building Affordable Housing for Families in Seattle
Targeted for completion in 2019, Redmond Ridge Apartments is located just 15 miles from downtown Seattle
in the highly desirable neighborhood
of Redmond. This 109-unit townhome community is oriented toward families and their needs, offering larger units, an outdoor pool, an indoor sports court, and a children’s playground. The average rental rate is less than half that of comparable market rate apartments, and all units are limited to tenants that earn less than 60% of the average area median income.
East West is the lender for this project, providing a construction loan and long- term financing, as well as helping our customer enter into an interest rate swap to hedge against interest rate risk.
Preserving Low-Income Housing for Seniors in San Francisco
As one of the nation’s most expensive places to live, San Francisco is a city
with a critical need for affordable
housing. A joint initiative between East West, the Mayor’s Office of Housing
and Community of San Francisco, and
the non-profit Chinatown Community Development Center resulted in the purchase and designation of two buildings in the Richmond District as permanent affordable housing. The two adjoining buildings are home to long-term tenants, who are predominantly Chinese-American seniors, with an income of less than 20% of the average area median income.

Cover Art
 Cai Guo-Qiang is a contemporary painter, installation and performance artist who
was born in 1957 in Quanzhou, Fujian, China. Cai is considered to be one of the most influential contemporary Chinese artists today. By utilizing the unusual mediums
of gunpowder and fireworks in his art, the force of Cai’s work transcends the two dimensional plane to engage the participants with the larger universe around them.
Cai has won many awards, including the Golden Lion at the 48th Venice Biennale in 1999. In 2012, Cai was the first Chinese national to receive the Praemium Imperiale, a prestigious award recognizing artists for their excellence and international impact in the arts.
In 2008, as director of visual and special effects of the Summer Olympics in Beijing,
Cai orchestrated the “giant footprints” fireworks display. Cai’s 2015 Sky Ladder, a project that involved a 1,650-foot ladder rigged with gunpowder, was the subject of a Netflix documentary by Academy Award-winning director Kevin Macdonald.
Most recently, Cai created a series of exhibitions for major European museums as
part of a tour titled An Individual’s Journey through Western Art History. Each distinct exhibition juxtaposes Cai’s work, including pyrotechnical explosions, against a different period of western art. The exhibitions have been shown at the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow, Russia, the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain, the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, Italy, and the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, Italy.
