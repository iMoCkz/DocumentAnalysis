YEAR IN REVIEW
Dear Shareholders:
The year 2018 marked our 125th anniversary. It was a strong year for Popular, during which we accomplished important milestones and achieved solid financial results.
In the beginning of the year, we were addressing remaining hurricane- related issues and faced much uncertainty regarding the recovery of the Puerto Rican economy. Despite these challenges, we remained focused on serving our customers, executing our business strategies and seizing opportunities that arose.
• We completed the acquisition of approximately $2 billion in auto and auto-related commercial loans from Reliable, Wells Fargo’s auto finance business in Puerto Rico. We are happy to have brought on board a seasoned and talented team and we are excited about the prospects of our auto business, currently one of the best performing sectors in the Puerto Rican economy. The transaction, which closed on August 1, contributed approximately $30 million to net income.
• We successfully negotiated the early termination of our shared- loss agreements with the FDIC, which gives us greater flexibility to manage these assets and simplifies our financial reporting. The termination, combined with a related tax benefit, contributed $159 million to net income.
• We executed several capital actions, including a $125 million common stock repurchase. In addition, early in 2019, we announced a series of planned actions for the year, which include an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 to $0.30 per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to $250 million. These actions evidence the strength of our capital position, which allows us to return capital to our shareholders at the same time we invest in our franchise to ensure its continued success.
Net income in 2018 reached $618 million, compared with $108 million in 2017. Our 2018 results include the $159 million benefit related to the early termination of the FDIC shared-loss agreements and a $28 million expense related to the impact of the Puerto Rico tax reform on our deferred tax asset (DTA). Net income in 2017 included a $168 million expense resulting from the impact of the U.S. tax reform on our DTA.
After excluding the effect of these items, adjusted net income for 2018 was $487 million, compared to $276 million in the previous year. While adjusted results for 2017 were adversely affected by the hurricanes, in 2018 we benefitted from the contribution of the Reliable acquisition, deposit growth and higher interest rates.
2018 ANNUAL REPORT | 1

Credit quality results for the year were positive. In Puerto Rico, most metrics ended the year better than or close to pre-hurricane levels. In the United States, excluding the taxi medallion portfolio that now has a carrying value of less than $50 million, credit quality was solid throughout the year.
Popular’s shares closed 2018 at $47.22, 33% higher than 2017. This performance compares positively against our U.S. peers and the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (“KRX”), which declined by 18% and 19%, respectively. In fact, Popular was the best performing bank in the KRX, outperforming the Index throughout 2018 due to the Island’s steady economic recovery after the 2017 hurricanes, strong earnings and stable credit quality metrics.
We continued to support our communities through Fundación Banco Popular and Popular Foundation, donating $2.3 million to 96 non-profit organizations in Puerto Rico and the United States. We also continued the deployment of funds raised for Embracing Puerto Rico, a program launched immediately after Hurricane Maria to assist those areas most affected by the disaster. While initial efforts centered on providing immediate relief, the fund is now focused on longer-term projects in the areas of education, sustainable infrastructure, access to primary health services, and the promotion of socially innovative ideas.
Early in 2018, I encouraged our employees to preserve the spirit and the attitudes that allowed us to overcome the previous year’s challenges and become a better organization as a result of them. Once again, they rose to the occasion. Their energy and dedication made possible the accomplishments that I have shared with you. In recognition of our results and achievements, our Board of Directors approved the maximum possible award under our Profit Sharing Plan.
We want to extend our most sincere gratitude to our Directors for their support. Late last year, David E. Goel retired from the Board to devote more time to other professional endeavors. We are very grateful for David’s thoughtful contributions during his six years of service. We welcomed two new Directors, Myrna Soto and Robert Carrady, whose skills and expertise are an excellent complement to our existing Board. Myrna Soto has many years of experience in cyber security, a field that becomes more critical every day. Myrna is currently a partner at ForgePoint Capital, a venture capital firm concentrating exclusively on cyber security related companies, and was previously the Senior Vice President and Global Chief Information Security Officer of Comcast Corporation. Robert Carrady is the President of Caribbean Cinemas, a family-owned business and the largest movie theater chain in the Caribbean. We are fortunate to count on his entrepreneurial perspective, as well as his thorough understanding of the Caribbean region, one of the markets where Popular operates. It is a privilege to have a first-rate Board of Directors which is an important source of leadership, guidance and support.
We begin 2019 on a solid footing and excited about our prospects for the year. The strength of our franchise in Puerto Rico has provided meaningful earnings power, even in the most difficult of times, and puts us in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities stemming from the economic recovery on the Island. Our growth initiatives in the United States have good traction, and we expect to see further progress.
We are determined to make the most of this positive momentum to continue delivering solid results and creating value for our shareholders.
IGNACIO ALVAREZ President and Chief Executive Officer Popular, Inc.

  Sustainable and profitable growth
Simplicity
Customer focus
During 2018 we also made progress in each of the strategic pillars we established last year.
In Puerto Rico, we completed the Reliable acquisition, increased consumer loan originations, particularly in the auto business, grew deposits by 14% and maintained a strong margin. We also increased our customer base by 50,000, not including approximately 30,000 new unique customers brought in with the Reliable transaction. In the United States, we grew commercial loans by 7%, driven by healthy growth in niche businesses in which we have developed a competitive advantage, and increased our margin.
We advanced projects to streamline our organization, leveraging technology and process optimization to reduce costs, improve quality and agility, enable a superior customer and employee experience, and provide a platform for future growth. For example, we implemented a project to improve the mortgage origination process and advanced the deployment of robotic process automation (RPA) technology to handle tasks that are costly, repetitive, and do not contribute to the customer or employee experience.
We enhanced our processes to measure our customers’ experience and implemented targeted initiatives to improve it. We continued to make progress in the migration of transactions to digital channels. In 2018, 47% of our deposit transactions in Puerto Rico and 45% in the United States were processed through smart ATMs and mobile devices, a figure that has been increasing consistently. We also advanced the transformation of our retail network in the United States, a multidimensional effort we embarked on several years ago in order to create a superior customer experience, streamline and reengineer branch processes and use our real estate in a more efficient manner. Approximately half of our U.S. branches have been transformed to the new model.
Convinced that the success of our business strategies requires a solid foundation, we continued to bolster our talent management and risk management frameworks. We increased our minimum base salary in all our markets, enhanced our wellness initiatives and strengthened our leadership development programs. In addition, we executed a voluntary retirement program to facilitate our colleagues’ transition to retirement and to provide talent development opportunities and facilitate mobility within the organization. With respect to risk management, we continued to invest in our compliance area and created the Corporate Security Group. This group, led by Betina Castellví as the Chief Security Officer, consolidates all corporate efforts related to cyber security and enterprise fraud. Betina’s career at Popular, which spans over 20 years, includes leadership roles in several areas, such as financial, operational and market risk and, most recently, the position of General Auditor.
This strategic framework keeps us focused on our priorities and ensures we balance present and future needs.
                                 Fit for the Future

POPULAR, INC.
RESUMEN DEL AÑO
Estimados accionistas:
En el 2018 celebramos nuestro 125 aniversario. Fue un excelente año para Popular, durante el cual alcanzamos logros importantes y resultados financieros sólidos.
A principios de año, nos encontrábamos abordando los problemas que quedaban relacionados con los huracanes y enfrentábamos mucha incertidumbre con respecto a la recuperación de la economía de Puerto Rico. A pesar de estos desafíos, nos mantuvimos enfocados en servir a nuestros clientes, ejecutar nuestras estrategias comerciales y aprovechar las oportunidades que se presentaron.
• Completamos la adquisición de aproximadamente $2,000 millones en préstamos de automóviles y préstamos comerciales de Reliable, el negocio de financiamiento de automóviles de Wells Fargo en Puerto Rico. Nos complace haber incorporado a un equipo experimentado y talentoso, y estamos entusiasmados con las perspectivas de nuestro negocio de financiamiento de autos, que actualmente es uno de los sectores con mejor desempeño en la economía de Puerto Rico. La transacción, que se cerró el 1 de agosto, contribuyó aproximadamente $30 millones al ingreso neto.
• Negociamos, exitosamente, la terminación anticipada de los acuerdos de participación en pérdidas con la FDIC, lo que nos brinda una mayor flexibilidad para administrar estos activos y simplifica nuestros informes financieros. La terminación, combinada con un beneficio contributivo relacionado, contribuyó $159 millones al ingreso neto.
• Ejecutamos varias acciones de capital, incluyendo la recompra de $125 millones en acciones comunes. Además, a principios de 2019, anunciamos una serie de acciones planificadas para el año, que incluyen un aumento en el dividendo trimestral de $0.25 a $0.30 por acción común y un programa de recompra de acciones comunes de hasta $250 millones. Estas acciones evidencian la fortaleza de nuestra posición de capital, que nos permite devolver capital a nuestros accionistas a la vez que invertimos en nuestro negocio para garantizar su éxito futuro.
El ingreso neto para el 2018 alcanzó $618 millones, comparado con $108 millones en el 2017. Nuestros resultados en el 2018 incluyen el beneficio de $159 millones relacionado con la terminación anticipada de los acuerdos de participación en pérdidas con la FDIC, y un gasto de $28 millones relacionado al impacto de la reforma contributiva en Puerto Rico en nuestro activo de contribuciones diferidas. El ingreso neto en 2017 incluyó un gasto de $168 millones como resultado del impacto de la reforma fiscal de los Estados Unidos en nuestro activo de contribuciones diferidas.
2018 INFORME ANUAL | 7

Excluyendo estas partidas, el ingreso neto ajustado en el 2018 fue $487 millones, comparado con $276 millones en el año anterior. Mientras que los resultados ajustados del 2017 se impactaron negativamente por los huracanes, en el 2018 nos beneficiamos de la contribución de la adquisición de Reliable, el crecimiento en nuestros depósitos y aumentos en las tasas de interés.
Los resultados de calidad crediticia del año fueron positivos. En Puerto Rico, la mayoría de los indicadores terminaron el año mejor que o cerca de los niveles previos a los huracanes. En los Estados Unidos, excluyendo la cartera de licencias taxis que ahora tiene un valor en libros de menos de $50 millones, la calidad crediticia se mantuvo sólida durante todo el año.
Las acciones de Popular cerraron el 2018 en $47.22, 33% más alto que en el 2017. Este desempeño compara positivamente con nuestros bancos pares en los Estados Unidos y con el Índice Regional de Bancos de KBW (“KRX”), que disminuyeron 18% y 19%, respectivamente. De hecho, Popular fue el banco con mejor desempeño en el KRX, superando al Índice a lo largo del 2018 debido a la recuperación económica sostenida de la Isla después de los huracanes del 2017, ganancias sólidas y calidad crediticia estable.
Continuamos apoyando a nuestras comunidades a través de la Fundación Banco Popular y la Popular Foundation, donando $2.3 millones a 96 organizaciones sin fines de lucro en Puerto Rico y los Estados Unidos. También continuamos con la distribución de los fondos recaudados para Abrazando a Puerto Rico, un programa que iniciamos inmediatamente después del huracán María para ayudar a las áreas más afectadas por el fenómeno atmosférico. Mientras que los esfuerzos iniciales se centraron en brindar ayuda inmediata, el fondo ahora está enfocado en proyectos a más largo plazo en las áreas de educación, infraestructura sostenible, acceso a servicios de salud y la promoción de ideas socialmente innovadoras.
A principios del 2018, exhorté a nuestros empleados a preservar el espíritu y las actitudes que nos permitieron superar los desafíos del año anterior y, como resultado, convertirnos en una mejor organización. Una vez más, estuvieron a la altura de las circunstancias. Su energía y dedicación hicieron posible los logros que he compartido con ustedes. Como reconocimiento de nuestros resultados y logros, nuestra Junta de Directores aprobó el mayor incentivo posible bajo nuestro Plan de Participación en Ganancias.
Queremos expresar nuestro más sincero agradecimiento a nuestros Directores por su apoyo. A finales del año pasado, David E. Goel se retiró de la Junta para dedicar más tiempo a otros esfuerzos profesionales. Estamos muy agradecidos por sus contribuciones durante sus seis años de servicio. Dimos la bienvenida a dos nuevos Directores, Myrna Soto y Robert Carrady, cuyas destrezas y experiencia son un excelente complemento a nuestra Junta existente. Myrna Soto tiene muchos años de experiencia en seguridad cibernética, un campo que se vuelve más crítico cada día. Myrna es actualmente socia de ForgePoint Capital, una firma de capital de riesgo que se concentra exclusivamente en compañías relacionadas con la seguridad cibernética, y anteriormente fue Vicepresidente Senior y Directora Global de Seguridad de Información de Comcast Corporation. Robert Carrady es el Presidente de Caribbean Cinemas, una empresa familiar y la mayor cadena de cines en el Caribe, con operaciones en Puerto Rico, República Dominicana y varias otras islas del Caribe, así como en Guyana, Panamá y Bolivia. Somos afortunados de contar con su perspectiva empresarial, así como con su conocimiento de la región del Caribe, uno de los mercados donde opera Popular. Es un privilegio tener una Junta de Directores de primer nivel, que es una fuente importante de liderazgo, orientación y apoyo.
Comenzamos el 2019 en una base sólida y entusiasmados con nuestras perspectivas para el año. La fortaleza de nuestra franquicia en Puerto Rico se ha traducido en ganancias significativas, incluso en los momentos más difíciles, y nos coloca en una excelente posición para aprovechar las oportunidades relacionadas a la recuperación económica en la Isla. Nuestras iniciativas de crecimiento en los Estados Unidos tienen buena tracción y confiamos que seguirán progresando.
Estamos decididos a aprovechar al máximo este impulso positivo para continuar alcanzando resultados sólidos, y creando valor para nuestros accionistas.

  Crecimiento sostenible y rentable
Sencillez
Enfoque en el cliente
Durante el 2018 también progresamos en cada uno de los pilares estratégicos que establecimos el año pasado.
En Puerto Rico, completamos la adquisición de Reliable, aumentamos las originaciones de préstamos de consumo, particularmente en el negocio de financiamiento de autos, crecimos los depósitos por un 14% y mantuvimos un margen fuerte. Además, aumentamos nuestra base de clientes por 50,000, sin incluir aproximadamente 30,000 clientes nuevos que se unieron a Popular con la adquisición de Reliable. En los Estados Unidos, aumentamos los préstamos comerciales por un 7%, impulsados por un crecimiento saludable en nichos específicos en los que hemos desarrollado una ventaja competitiva, y ampliamos nuestro margen.
Adelantamos proyectos para simplificar nuestra organización, aprovechando la tecnología y el rediseño de procesos para reducir costos, mejorar la calidad y agilidad, permitir una experiencia superior a clientes y empleados, y proporcionar una plataforma para el crecimiento futuro. Por ejemplo, implementamos un proyecto para mejorar el proceso de originación de hipotecas y avanzamos en el despliegue de la tecnología de automatización robótica de procesos para manejar tareas que son costosas, repetitivas y no contribuyen a la experiencia del cliente o empleado.
Mejoramos nuestros procesos para medir la experiencia de nuestros clientes e implementamos iniciativas específicas para mejorarla. Continuamos progresando en la migración de transacciones a canales digitales. En el 2018, el 47% de nuestras transacciones de depósito en Puerto Rico y el 45% en los Estados Unidos se procesaron a través de cajeros automáticos inteligentes y dispositivos móviles, una cifra que ha aumentado consistentemente. También, avanzamos en la transformación de nuestra red de sucursales en los Estados Unidos, un esfuerzo multidimensional que emprendimos hace varios años, para mejorar la experiencia de nuestros clientes, rediseñar los procesos de las sucursales y utilizar nuestros bienes raíces de una manera más eficiente. Aproximadamente la mitad de nuestras sucursales en los Estados Unidos se han transformado al nuevo modelo.
Convencidos de que el éxito de nuestras estrategias de negocio requiere una base sólida, continuamos fortaleciendo las estructuras de gestión de talento y de manejo de riesgos. Aumentamos el salario base en todos nuestros mercados, reforzamos las iniciativas de bienestar y fortalecimos los programas de desarrollo de liderazgo. Además, llevamos a cabo un programa de retiro voluntario para facilitar la transición de nuestros colegas al retiro y brindar oportunidades de desarrollo de talento y movilidad dentro de la organización. Con respecto al manejo de riesgos, continuamos invirtiendo en el área de cumplimiento y creamos el Grupo de Seguridad Corporativa. Este grupo, liderado por Betina Castellví como la Principal Oficial de Seguridad, consolida todos los esfuerzos corporativos relacionados con la seguridad cibernética y el fraude. La carrera de Betina en Popular, que abarca más de 20 años, incluye roles de liderazgo en varias áreas, tales como riesgo financiero, operacional y de mercado y, más recientemente, la posición de Auditora General.
Este marco estratégico nos mantiene enfocados en nuestras prioridades y asegura que equilibramos las necesidades presentes y futuras.
                                      Preparados para el futuro

2 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides information which management believes is necessary for understanding the financial performance of Popular, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Corporation” or “Popular”). All accompanying tables, consolidated financial statements, and corresponding notes included in this “Financial Review and Supplementary Information - 2018 Annual Report” (“the report”) should be considered an integral part of this MD&A.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The information included in this report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements about Popular Inc.’s (the “Corporation,” “Popular,” “we,” “us,” “our”) business, financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives and future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are based on management’s current expectations and, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions. Potential factors, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and our reaction to those factors, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, delinquency trends, market risk and the impact of interest rate changes, capital markets conditions, capital adequacy and liquidity, and the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings and new accounting standards on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continues,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “project” and similar expressions and future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” “may” or similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward- looking statements.
Various factors, some of which are beyond Popular’s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the rate of growth or decline in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions in the geographic areas we serve and, in particular, in Puerto Rico, where a significant portion of our business is concentrated; the impact of the current fiscal and economic challenges of Puerto Rico and the measures taken and to be taken by the Puerto Rico Government and the Federally- appointed oversight board on the economy, our customers and our business; the impact of the pending debt restructuring proceedings under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act and of other actions
taken or to be taken to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal challenges on the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities and loans to governmental entities and of our commercial, mortgage and consumer loan portfolios where private borrowers could be directly affected by governmental action; the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the measures taken to recover from these hurricanes (including the availability of relief funds and insurance proceeds), on the economy of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands, and on our customers and our business; changes in interest rates and market liquidity, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect our ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies; changes in federal bank regulatory and supervisory policies, including required levels of capital and the impact of proposed capital standards on our capital ratios; additional Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments; regulatory approvals that may be necessary to undertake certain actions or consummate strategic transactions such as acquisitions and dispositions; hurricanes and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, which could cause a disruption in our operations or other adverse consequences for our business; the ability to successfully integrate the auto finance business acquired from Wells Fargo & Company, as well as unexpected costs, including, without limitation, costs due to exposure to any unrecorded liabilities or issues not identified during the due diligence investigation of the business or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement, and risks that the business may suffer as a result of the transaction, including due to adverse effects on relationships with customers, employees and service providers; the relative strength or weakness of the consumer and commercial credit sectors and of the real estate markets in Puerto Rico and the other markets in which borrowers are located; the performance of the stock and bond markets; competition in the financial services industry; possible legislative, tax or regulatory changes; and a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of EVERTEC, Inc., our provider of core financial transaction processing and information technology services, or of other third parties providing services to us, including as a result of cyberattacks, e-fraud, denial-of-services and computer intrusion, that might result in loss or breach of customer data, disruption of services, reputational damage or additional costs to Popular. Other possible events or factors that could cause results or performance to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements include the following: negative economic conditions that adversely affect housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of non-performing assets, charge-offs and provision expense; changes in market rates and prices which may adversely impact
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 3

the value of financial assets and liabilities; liabilities resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; changes in accounting standards, rules and interpretations; our ability to grow our core businesses; decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change our business mix; and management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. Moreover, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, as discussed in “Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of the Corporation’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, is inherently uncertain and depends on judicial interpretations of law and the findings of regulators, judges and/or juries.
All forward-looking statements included in this report are based upon information available to the Corporation as of the date of this report, and other than as required by law, including the requirements of applicable securities laws, we assume no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
The description of the Corporation’s business and risk factors contained in Item 1 and 1A of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 discusses additional information about the business of the Corporation and the material risk factors that, in addition to the other information in this report, readers should consider.
OVERVIEW
The Corporation is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (“U.S.”) mainland, and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage, and commercial banking services through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (“BPPR”), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto and equipment leasing and financing, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (“PB”), which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and Florida. Note 39 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation’s business segments.
The Corporation has several investments which it accounts for under the equity method. These include the 16.10% interest in EVERTEC, a 15.84% interest in Centro Financiero BHD Leon, S.A. (“BHD Leon”), a 24.9% interest in PR Asset Portfolio 2013-1 International, LLC and a 24.9% interest in PRLP 2011 Holdings LLP, among other investments in limited partnerships which mainly hold investment securities. EVERTEC provides transaction processing services throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, including servicing many of the Corporation’s systems infrastructure and transaction
processing businesses. BHD León is a diversified financial services institution operating in the Dominican Republic. PR Asset Portfolio 2013-1 International, LLC is a joint venture to which the Corporation sold construction and commercial loans and commercial and residential real estate owned assets, most of which were non-performing during the year 2013. PRLP 2011 Holdings LLP is a joint venture to which the Corporation sold construction and commercial loans, most of which were non-performing during the year 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation recorded approximately $38.0 million in earnings from these investments on an aggregate basis. The carrying amounts of these investments as of December 31, 2018 were $228.1 million. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of the Corporation’s investments under the equity method.
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE YEAR 2018
Name Change and rebranding of Popular’s U.S. Operations
On April 9, 2018, the Corporation’s New York-chartered banking subsidiary changed its legal name from Banco Popular North America to Popular Bank. Formerly operating as “Popular Community Bank”, Popular Bank will use the brand “Popular” to market its businesses. As a result of the rebranding initiative, the Corporation now operates under a single brand, “Popular”, throughout all its regions – the United States mainland, Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands – for the first time in the Corporation’s history.
Early Termination of FDIC Shared-Loss Agreements
On May 22, 2018, BPPR entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) to terminate all Shared- Loss Agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Westernbank Puerto Rico through an FDIC-assisted transaction in 2010 (the “FDIC Transaction”).
The Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $94.6 million in connection to the Termination Agreement. The Corporation also recorded a net tax benefit, considering the related Tax Closing Agreement entered into with the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (the “Tax Closing Agreement”) of $63.9 million. The combined effect of the Termination Agreement and the Tax Closing Agreement was a contribution of $158.5 million to net income for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Reliable Acquisition
On August 1, 2018, Popular Auto, LLC (“Popular Auto”), Banco Popular de Puerto Rico’s auto finance subsidiary, completed the acquisition of approximately $1.6 billion in retail auto loans and $341 million in primarily auto-related commercial loans from Wells Fargo & Company’s (“Wells Fargo”) auto finance business in Puerto Rico (“Reliable”). The
4 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Corporation recorded goodwill of $ 43.8 million in connection with this transaction.
Redemption of Senior Notes
On October 15, 2018, the Corporation redeemed $450 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), funded with available cash and the proceeds from the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023. The Corporation recognized $12.5 million in expenses associated with the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and the redemption price of the 2019 Notes.
Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities
On September 7, 2018, Popular North America, Inc. (“PNA”) completed the redemption of all outstanding 8.327% Capital Securities, Series A (liquidation amount $1,000 per security and $52,865,000 in the aggregate) issued by BanPonce Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust established by PNA. The redemption price of each security was equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the securities plus accumulated and unpaid distributions up to and excluding the redemption date.
Common Stock Repurchase Plan
The Corporation completed a $125 million accelerated share repurchase transaction (“ASR”) with respect to its common stock. In connection therewith, the Corporation received 2,438,180 shares of common stock, based on a price of $51.27. The Corporation accounted for this as a treasury stock transaction.
Profit Sharing Plan
In 2016, the Corporation established a broad-based Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) where employees receive incentive compensation if the Corporation’s earnings results exceed targets set by the Board of Directors. As a result of the Corporation’s earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, eligible employees received incentive payments of up to $5,600 per employee, half of which was paid in cash and the other half as a contribution to their 401(K) Savings and Investment Plan. The Corporation recorded $25.5 million in personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the Profit Sharing Plan.
Voluntary Retirement Program
The Corporation has offered to eligible Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Island employees the opportunity to
participate in a Voluntary Retirement Program (the “VRP”). The VRP offered such employees monetary and other incentives in exchange for electing to retire, effective February 1, 2019. To qualify for the VRP, eligible employees must have attained 58 years of age and at least 10 years of service. A total of 314 eligible employees elected to participate in the VRP. Accordingly, the Corporation recognized $19.5 million in personnel costs related to compensation arrangements for VRP participants. The Corporation expects annual personnel costs savings of approximately $11 million as a result of the VRP.
Puerto Rico Tax Reform
The Corporation recognized a $27.7 million non-cash income tax expense as a result of a reduction in the net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) related to its Puerto Rico operations from the reduction in the Corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. This adjustment resulted in a reduction to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Total Regulatory Capital of approximately 3 basis points.
Planned Capital Actions for 2019
On January 23, 2019, the Corporation announced the following actions as part of its capital plan for 2019: (i) an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, and (ii) up to $250 million in common stock repurchases. On February 15, 2019, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on its outstanding common stock, payable on April 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2019.
On February 28, 2019, the Corporation entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction of $250 million with respect to its common stock, which was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction. Accordingly, as a result of the receipt of the initial shares, the Corporation recognized in shareholders’ equity approximately $200 million in treasury stock and $50 million as a reduction of capital surplus. The Corporation expects to further adjust its treasury stock and capital surplus accounts to reflect the delivery or receipt of cash or shares upon the termination of the ASR agreement, which will depend on the average price of the Corporation’s shares during the term of the ASR.

6 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Adjusted results of operations – Non-GAAP financial measure
Adjusted net income
The Corporation prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or the “reported basis”). In addition to analyzing the Corporation’s results on a reported basis, management monitors Adjusted net income of the Corporation and excludes the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. Management believes that Adjusted net income provides meaningful information to investors about the underlying performance of the Corporation’s ongoing operations. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to tables 37 to 39 for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted net income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis
Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, is presented with its different components on Tables 3 and 4 for the years ended December 31, 2018 as compared with the same periods in 2017 and 2016, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.
The interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, and certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its agencies and assets held by the Corporation’s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by the Puerto Rico tax law. Under this law, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and exempt sources.
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018
In 2018 we benefited from deposit growth and higher interest rates, as well as the contribution of the Reliable acquisition,
while in 2017 we had the negative effects of the Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Corporation’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $618.2 million, compared to a net income of $107.7 million and $216.7 million, for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The results for the year ended December 31, 2018 include a pre-tax gain of $94.6 million resulting from the Termination Agreement with the FDIC previously disclosed; a net income tax benefit of $63.9 million resulting from the impact of the Termination Agreement and the related Tax Closing Agreement; and $27.7 million non-cash income tax expense as a result of a reduction in the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset related to the Puerto Rico operations due to the reduction in tax rates as a result of an amendment to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $107.7 million. The Corporation’s results for the year 2017, include the impact of an income tax expense of $168.4 million related to the impact of the Federal Tax Cuts and Job Act on the Corporation’s U.S. deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the expenses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria of approximately $88 million, on a pre-tax basis, during the third and fourth quarters of 2017.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $216.7 million. The Corporation’s results include the impact of two unfavorable arbitration review board decisions in disputes with the FDIC, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $171.8 million related to unreimbursed losses considered in the arbitrations, the related adjustment to the true-up obligation owed to the FDIC and recoveries previously incorporated in the net damages claimed in the arbitration.
Excluding the impact of the above mentioned transactions, detailed in Tables 37 through 39, the Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $487.3 million, compared to $276.0 million for 2017 and $358.1 million for 2016. Refer to Tables 37 through 39 for the reconciliation to the Adjusted net income.

Netincome(loss)
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $232.9 million when compared to 2017. The increase in net interest income was mainly driven by the acquisition of $1.9 billion of loans from the Reliable Transaction, the increase in the bond and money market portfolio, and the related positive impact due to the change in interest rates in those assets, partially offset by an increase in total interest-bearing liabilities and its funding costs. Refer to the Net Interest Income section of this MD&A for additional information.
The Corporation’s total provision for loan losses totaled $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $325.4 million for 2017. The decrease was mainly due to last year’s incremental provision of $67.7 million due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Non-performing assets totaled $748 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting a slight increase of $5 million when compared to December 31, 2017. Refer to the Provision for Loan Losses and Credit Risk sections of this MD&A for information on the allowance for loan losses, non-performing assets, troubled debt restructurings, net charge-offs and credit quality metrics.
Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $652.5 million, an increase of $233.3 million, when compared with 2017. The increase was mainly due to a favorable variance on the FDIC loss share income (expense) of $104.8 million as a result of the Termination Agreement with the FDIC during the year, higher income from mortgage banking activities by $27.3 million and higher other operating income by $47.1 million mainly resulting from insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Maria. Refer to the Non-Interest Income section of this MD&A for additional information on the major variances of the different categories of non-interest income.

Total operating expenses amounted to $1.4 billion for the year 2018, compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Operating expenses for 2018 were impacted by higher personnel cost by $86.2 million mainly related to the VRP, profit sharing expenses and other incentive compensation, higher professional fees, including those related to the Termination Agreement with the FDIC, an expense of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the 2019 Senior Notes and the write-down of $19.6 million of capitalized software costs for a project discontinued by the Corporation. Refer to the Operating Expenses section of this MD&A for additionalinformation.
Income tax expense amounted to $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with an income tax expense of $230.8 million for the previous year. For the year 2018, the Corporation recognized a net income tax benefit of $63.9 million related to the impact of the Termination Agreement, discussed above, and an income tax expense of $27.7 million due to a reduction in the Puerto Rico corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. During 2017, the Corporation recognized an income tax expense of $168.4 million resulting from the impact of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the Corporation’s income tax expense. Refer to the Income Taxes section in this MD&A and Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s total assets were $47.6 billion, compared with $44.3 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 billion, mainly driven by an increase in the Corporation’s debt securities available-for-sale portfolio by $3.1 billion and the acquisition of the Reliable loan portfolio, partially offset by a reduction in cash and money market investments. Refer to the Statement of Condition Analysis section of this MD&A for additional information.

Deposits amounted to $39.7 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $35.5 billion at December 31, 2017. Table 8 presents a breakdown of deposits by major categories. The increase in deposits was mainly due to higher Puerto Rico public sector and private demand deposits at BPPR. The Corporation’s borrowings totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the Corporation’s borrowings.
Refer to Table 7 in the Statement of Financial Condition Analysis section of this MD&A for the percentage allocation of the composition of the Corporation’s financing to total assets.
Stockholders’ equity totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $5.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to net income of $618.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a cumulative effect of accounting change of $1.9 million, partially offset by the recognition of $125 million in treasury stock as part of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, higher unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale by $71.6 million, declared dividends of $101.3 million on common stock ($0.25 per share) and $3.7 million in dividends on preferred stock. The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries continue to be well-capitalized at December 31, 2018. The Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio at December 31, 2018 was 16.90%, compared to 16.30% at December 31, 2017.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES
The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and general practices within the financial services industry. The Corporation’s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with this section.
Critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions, which involve significant judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that involve a high degree of subjectivity. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. The following MD&A section is a summary of what management considers the Corporation’s critical accounting policies and estimates.
Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments
The Corporation currently measures at fair value on a recurring basis its trading debt securities, debt securities
available-for-sale, certain equity securities, derivatives and mortgage servicing rights. Occasionally, the Corporation may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, impaired loans held-in-portfolio that are collateral dependent and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets.
The Corporation categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value under the three-level hierarchy. The level within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement are observable.
The Corporation requires the use of observable inputs when available, in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument depends upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. In addition, it may be affected by other factors such as the type of instrument, the liquidity of the market for the instrument, transparency around the inputs to the valuation, as well as the contractual characteristics of the instrument.
Broker quotes used for fair value measurements inherently reflect any lack of liquidity in the market since they represent an exit price from the perspective of the market participants. Financial assets that were fair valued using broker quotes amounted to $7 million at December 31, 2018, of which $1 million were Level 3 assets and $ 6 million were Level 2 assets. Level 3 assets consisted principally of tax-exempt GNMA mortgage-backed securities. Fair value for these securities was based on an internally-prepared matrix derived from local broker quotes. The main input used in the matrix pricing was non-binding local broker quotes obtained from limited trade activity. Therefore, these securities were classified as Level 3.
Trading Debt Securities and Debt Securities Available-for-Sale
The majority of the values for trading debt securities and debt securities available-for-sale are obtained from third-party pricing services and are validated with alternate pricing sources when available. Securities not priced by a secondary pricing source are documented and validated internally according to their significance to the Corporation’s financial statements. Management has established materiality thresholds according to the investment class to monitor and investigate material deviations in prices obtained from the primary pricing service provider and the secondary pricing source used as support for the valuation results. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation did not adjust any prices obtained from pricing service providers or broker dealers.
  POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 9

Inputs are evaluated to ascertain that they consider current market conditions, including the relative liquidity of the market. When a market quote for a specific security is not available, the pricing service provider generally uses observable data to derive an exit price for the instrument, such as benchmark yield curves and trade data for similar products. To the extent trading data is not available, the pricing service provider relies on specific information including dialogue with brokers, buy side clients, credit ratings, spreads to established benchmarks and transactions on similar securities, to draw correlations based on the characteristics of the evaluated instrument. If for any reason the pricing service provider cannot observe data required to feed its model, it discontinues pricing the instrument. During the year ended December 31, 2018, none of the Corporation’s debt securities were subject to pricing discontinuance by the pricing service providers. The pricing methodology and approach of our primary pricing service providers is concluded to be consistent with the fair value measurement guidance.
Furthermore, management assesses the fair value of its portfolio of investment securities at least on a quarterly basis, which includes analyzing changes in fair value that have resulted in losses that may be considered other-than-temporary. Factors considered include, for example, the nature of the investment, severity and duration of possible impairments, industry reports, sector credit ratings, economic environment, creditworthiness of the issuers and any guarantees.
Securities are classified in the fair value hierarchy according to product type, characteristics and market liquidity. At the end of each period, management assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. The fair value measurement analysis performed by the Corporation includes validation procedures and review of market changes, pricing methodology, assumption and level hierarchy changes, and evaluation of distressed transactions.
Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Corporation’s valuation methodologies used for the assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses
Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as interest income based upon the principal amount outstanding.
Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income and the loan is accounted for either on a cash- basis method or on the cost-recovery method. Loans designated as non-accruing are returned to accrual status when the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan’s balance may involve management’s judgment in the evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for repayment.
Refer to the MD&A section titled Credit Risk, particularly the Non-performing assets sub-section, for a detailed description of the Corporation’s non-accruing and charge-off policies by major loan categories.
One of the most critical and complex accounting estimates is associated with the determination of the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses charged to current operations is based on this determination. The Corporation’s assessment of the allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with accounting guidance, specifically guidance of loss contingencies in ASC Subtopic 450-20 and loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35.
For a detailed description of the principal factors used to determine the general reserves of the allowance for loan losses and for the principal enhancements Management made to its methodology, refer to Note 9.
According to the loan impairment accounting guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35, a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the principal and/or interest are not going to be collected according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Current information and events include “environmental” factors, e.g. existing industry, geographical, economic and political factors. Probable means the future event or events which will confirm the loss or impairment of the loan is likely to occur. The collateral dependent method is generally used for the impairment determination on commercial and construction loans since the expected realizable value of the loan is based upon the proceeds received from the liquidation of the collateral property. For commercial properties, the “as is” value or the “income approach” value is used depending on the financial condition of the subject borrower and/or the nature of the subject collateral. In most cases, impaired commercial loans do not have reliable or sustainable cash flow to use the discounted cash flow valuation method. As a general rule, the appraisal valuation used by the Corporation for impaired construction loans is based on discounted value to a single purchaser, discounted sell out or “as is” depending on the condition and status of the project and the performance of the same. Appraisals may be adjusted due to their age, property conditions, geographical area or general market conditions. The adjustments applied are based upon internal information, like other appraisals and/or loss severity information that can provide historical trends in the real estate market. Discount rates used may change from time to time based on management’s estimates.
For additional information on the Corporation’s policy of its impaired loans, refer to Note 2. In addition, refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for detailed information on the Corporation’s collateral value estimation for other real estate.
The Corporation’s management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis following a systematic methodology in order to provide for known and
10 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

inherent risks in the loan portfolio. In developing its assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management’s estimates are the years of historical data to include when estimating losses, the level of volatility of losses in a specific portfolio, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurement, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Consequently, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could also be affected.
A restructuring constitutes a TDR when the Corporation separately concludes that the restructuring constitutes a concession and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. For information on the Corporation’s TDR policy, refer to Note 2.
Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality Accounted for Under ASC 310-30
ASC Subtopic 310-30 provides two specific criteria that have to be met in order for a loan to be within its scope: (1) credit deterioration on the loan from its inception until the acquisition date and (2) that it is probable that not all of the contractual cash flows will be collected on the loan. Once in the scope of ASC Subtopic 310-30, the credit portion of the fair value discount on an acquired loan cannot be accreted into income until the acquirer has assessed that it expects to receive more cash flows on the loan than initially anticipated.
Generally, acquired loans that meet the definition for nonaccrual status fall within the Corporation’s definition of impaired loans under ASC Subtopic 310-30. Also, for acquisitions that include a significant amount of impaired loans, an election can be made for non-impaired loans included in such transactions to apply the accretable yield method (expected cash flow model of ASC Subtopic 310-30), by analogy, to those loans. Those loans are disclosed as a loan that was acquired with credit deterioration and impairment.
Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, impaired loans are aggregated into pools based on loans that have common risk characteristics. Each loan pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Characteristics considered in pooling loans include loan type, interest rate type, accruing status, amortization type, rate index and source type. Once the pools are defined, the Corporation maintains the integrity of the pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single asset.
Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value of the loans, or the “accretable yield,” is recognized as interest income using the effective yield method over the estimated life of the loan if the timing and amount of the future cash flows of the pool is reasonably estimable. The non-accretable difference represents the difference between contractually required principal and interest and the cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized as interest income prospectively as an adjustment to accretable yield over the pool’s remaining life. Decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date are generally recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses.
Over the life of the acquired loans that are accounted under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the Corporation continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. The Corporation evaluates at each balance sheet date whether the present value of its loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased based on revised estimated cash flows and if so, recognizes a provision for loan loss in its Consolidated Statement of Operations and an allowance for loan losses in its Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. For any increases in cash flows expected to be collected from borrowers, the Corporation adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on the loans on a prospective basis over the pool’s remaininglife.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted.
The calculation of periodic income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. The Corporation has recorded two accruals for income taxes: (i) the net estimated amount currently due or to be received from taxing jurisdictions, including any reserve for potential examination issues, and (ii) a deferred income tax that represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how the Corporation recognizes assets and liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the tax
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 11

code. Differences in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could impact the Corporation’s financial position or its results of operations. In estimating taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance.
A deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence, including both positive and negative evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The realization of deferred tax assets requires the consideration of all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies.
Management evaluates the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction. The U.S. mainland operations are evaluated as a whole since a consolidated income tax return is filed; on the other hand, the deferred tax asset related to the Puerto Rico operations is evaluated on an entity by entity basis, since no consolidation is allowed in the income tax filing. Accordingly, this evaluation is composed of three major components: U.S. mainland operations, Puerto Rico banking operations and Holding Company.
For the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction, refer to Note 37.
Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. The Code provides a dividends-received deduction of 100% on dividends received from “controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.
Changes in the Corporation’s estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates, new business strategies, newly enacted guidance, and resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions. Such changes could affect the amount of accrued taxes. The Corporation has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules. Any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources.
The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of those future events. Changes in management’s current estimates, due to unanticipated events, could have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite its assessment that its tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, the Corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, the Corporation determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Corporation’s estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. The Corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
After consideration of the effect on U.S. federal tax of unrecognized U.S. state tax benefits, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including U.S. and Puerto Rico that, if recognized, would affect the Corporation’s effective tax rate, was approximately $9.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Refer to Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this subject matter. The Corporation anticipates a reduction in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, which could amount to approximately $4.7 million.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions, expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of examinations, litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, the Corporation believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from open years. From time to time, the Corporation is audited by various federal, state and local authorities regarding income tax matters. Although management believes its approach in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in
12 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

accordance with the accounting standards, it is possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than the tax position reflected in the Corporation’s income tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any, are appropriately recorded in the consolidated financial statement in the period determined. Such differences could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s income tax provision or benefit, or other tax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on the Corporation’s results of operations, financial position and / or cash flows for such period.
Goodwill
The Corporation’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment. Intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at least annually, and on a more frequent basis, if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place. Such events could include, among others, a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator, an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit.
Under applicable accounting standards, goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles (including any unrecognized intangible assets, such as unrecognized core deposits and trademark) as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The Corporation estimates the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit, consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of the assets and liabilities reflects market conditions, thus volatility in prices could have a material impact on the determination of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill at the impairment test date. The adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles at fair value are
for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards. BPPR and PB passed Step 1 in the annual test as of July 31, 2018. For a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed by the Corporation during the third quarter of 2018, refer to Note 17.
At December 31, 2018, goodwill amounted to $671 million. Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides the assignment of goodwill by reportable segment.
Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations
The Corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries. The Corporation also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees of BPPR. The non-contributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans (“the Pension Plans”) are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals.
The estimated benefit costs and obligations of the Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan (“OPEB Plan”) are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions, which can materially affect recorded amounts, including expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, termination rates, retirement rates and health care trend rates. Management applies judgment in the determination of these factors, which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the Corporation. The Corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the Pension Plans and OPEB Plan costs and obligations. Detailed information on the Plans and related valuation assumptions are included in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the long-term expected return on Pension Plans assets. The Pension Plans’ assets fair value at December 31, 2018 was $685.8 million. The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors, including a total fund return estimate based on a weighted-average of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan. Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return, inflation, credit spreads, equity risk premiums and excess return expectations.
As part of the review, the Corporation’s independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plan’s expected asset allocation for the year 2019 using the Willis Towers Watson US Expected Return Estimator.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 13

This analysis is reviewed by the Corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return, together with other data. This forecast reflects the actuarial firm’s view of expected long- term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator; for example, 8.5% for large cap stocks, 8.8% for small cap stocks, 9.0% for international stocks, 4.2% for aggregate fixed-income securities and 4.5% for long government/credit at January 1, 2019. A range of expected investment returns is developed, and this range relies both on forecasts and on broad- market historical benchmarks for expected returns, correlations, and volatilities for each asset class.
As a consequence of recent reviews, the Corporation decreased its expected return on plan assets for year 2019 to 5.3% and 6.0% for the Pension Plans. Expected rates of return of 5.5% and 6.0% had been used for 2018 and 6.50% had been used for 2017 for the Pension Plans. Since the expected return assumption is on a long-term basis, it is not materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations (either positive or negative) in the actual return on assets. The expected return can be materially impacted by a change in the plan’s asset allocation.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost (“pension expense”) for the Pension Plans amounted to $5.5 million in 2018. The total pension expense included a benefit of $40.2 million for the expected return on assets.
Pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets. For example, decreasing the expected rate of return for 2019 from 5.3% to 5.05% would increase the projected 2019 pension expense for the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Retirement Plan, the Corporation’s largest plan, by approximately $1.6 million.
If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the Corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa, if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation, the Corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation. This asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements, including other comprehensive income. The determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment, and any changes in those estimates could impact the Corporation’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Management believes that the fair value estimates of the Pension Plans assets are reasonable given the valuation methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as described in Note 29. Also, the compositions of the plan assets are primarily in equity and debt securities, which have readily determinable quoted market prices. The Corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded pension benefit obligation of $68.7 million at December 31, 2018.
The Corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the Willis Towers Watson RATE: Link (10/90) Model to discount
the expected projected cash flows of the plans. The Corporation used an equivalent single weighted average discount rate which ranged from 4.20% to 4.23% for the Pension Plans and 4.30% for the OPEB Plan to determine the benefit obligations at December 31, 2018.
A 50 basis point decrease to each of the rates in the December 31, 2018 Willis Towers Watson RATE: Link (10/90) Model as of the beginning of 2019 would increase the projected 2019 expense for the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Retirement Plan by approximately $2.1 million. The change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the Pension Plans.
The OPEB Plan was unfunded (no assets were held by the plan) at December 31, 2018. The Corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of $153.4 million at December 31, 2018. Assumed health care trend rates may have significant effects on the amounts reported for the OPEB Plan. Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides information on the assumed rates considered by the Corporation and on the sensitivity that a one-percentage point change in the assumed rate may have on specified cost components and the postretirement benefit obligation of the Corporation.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated from earning assets, including loan fees, less the interest cost of deposits and borrowed money. Several risk factors might influence net interest income including the economic environment in which we operate, market driven events, changes in volumes, repricing characteristics, loans fees collected, moratoriums granted on loan payments and delay charges, interest collected on nonaccrual loans, as well as strategic decisions made by the Corporation’s management. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 2017.
As a result of the May 2018 termination of the loss share agreements (the “FDIC Shared-Loss Agreements”) entered into with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Westernbank, the presentation of net interest income has been adjusted to present the balances and income from the loans acquired from Westernbank (the “WB Loans”) in their respective loan segments. Previously, the Corporation presented the income associated with the WB Loans aggregated into a single line in its analysis of average balances and yields (Tables 3 and 4). The presentation for prior periods has been adjusted accordingly, for comparative purposes.
14 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The average key index rates for the years 2016 through 2018 were as follows:
increase in market interest rates experienced in the last two years. Average rate of such portfolios increased 72 basis points when compared to the same period in 2017;
• Higher interest income from investment securities mainly from higher volumes, particularly on U.S. Treasuries related to recent purchases to deploy liquidity and benefit from the Puerto Rico tax exemption of these assets;
• Higher income from commercial and construction loans due to a higher volume of loans in the U.S. and improved yields in Puerto Rico mostly related to the effect on the variable rate portfolio of the above-mentioned rise in interest rates and the commercial loans acquired in the Reliable transaction; and
• Higher income from auto loans mainly due to the Reliable acquisition, which contributed $89.2 million to interest income, including the amortization of the fair value discount of $28.1 million, and improved activity in auto loan financing in Puerto Rico during 2018.
These positive variances were partially offset by:
• Lower interest income from mortgage loans due to lower yields in Puerto Rico impacted by a reduction in fees collected from delayed mortgages due to the moratorium period related to the hurricanes; and
• Higher interest expense on deposits mainly due to higher volumes in most categories, predominantly the increase in deposits from the Puerto Rico government, retail and corporate deposits and higher volumes in the U.S. to fund loan growth.
Table 4 presents the different components of the Corporation’s net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with the same period in 2016, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin decreased by 23 basis points to 3.99% in 2017, compared to 4.22% in 2016 mainly due to the mix in the asset composition, as balances have increased in lower yielding bond and money market investments. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin was 4.28% in 2017, compared to 4.48% in 2016. In the low interest rate environment that has prevailed in the past years, the mix and overall size of our earning assets and the cost of funding those assets, although accretive to net interest income, has negatively impacted the Corporation’s net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $79.9 million year over year. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased by $101.3 million. The increase of $21.4 million in the taxable equivalent adjustment is directly related to a higher volume of tax-exempt investments in Puerto Rico.
As a mentioned above, as a result of the May 2018 termination of the FDIC Shared-Loss Agreements, the

  Average outstanding securities balances are based upon amortized cost excluding any unrealized gains or losses on securities available-for-sale. Non-accrual loans have been included in the respective average loans and leases categories. Loan fees collected, and costs incurred in the origination of loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest yield. Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the amortization of premiums / discounts on purchased loans are also included as part of the loan yield. Interest income for the period ended December 31, 2018 included a favorable impact, excluding the discount accretion on covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30, of $47.2 million, related to those items, compared to $19.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $28.2 million is mainly due to the amortization of the fair value discount related to the Reliable acquisition during the third quarter of 2018.
Table 3 presents the different components of the Corporation’s net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with the same period in 2017, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin increased by 2 basis points to 4.01% in 2018, compared to 3.99% in 2017. The increase in net interest margin is mainly driven by the acquisition of $1.9 billion of loans in the Reliable transaction, the increase in the bond and money market portfolio, and the related positive impact due to the change in interest rates in those assets. These positive drivers were partially offset by the increase in total interest-bearing liabilities and its funding costs. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin was 4.34% in 2018, compared to 4.28% in 2017. Net interest income increased by $232.9 million year over year. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased by $265.0 million. The increase of $32.1 million in the taxable equivalent adjustment is directly related to a higher volume of tax-exempt investments in Puerto Rico. The main reasons for the variances in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis were as follows:
• Higher interest income from money market investments due to both an increase in volume of funds available to invest, mainly related to an increase in Puerto Rico government, retail and corporate deposits, and to the
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 15

presentation of net interest income has been adjusted to present the balances and income from the loans acquired from WB loans in their respective loan segments and adjusted for prior periods.
The main variances in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years 2017 versus 2016 were as follows:
• Higher interest income from money market investments due to both an increase in volume of funds available to invest, mainly related to an increase in Puerto Rico government deposits, and to increases in rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Average rate of such portfolios for the year increased 62 basis points when compared to the same period in 2016;
• Higher interest income from investment securities mainly from higher volumes, particularly on U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities related to recent purchases; and
• Higher income from commercial and construction loans; due to a higher volume of loans in the U.S. and improved
yields in Puerto Rico mostly related to the effect on the variable rate portfolio of the above-mentioned rise in interest rates.
These positive variances were partially offset by:
• Lower interest income from mortgage loans due to lower average balances driven by lower lending activity, the above-mentioned waiver of late payment fees to clients and portfolio run-off in Puerto Rico and the U.S.; and
• Higher interest expense on deposits mainly due to higher volumes in most categories, predominantly the increase in deposits from the Puerto Rico government and higher volumes in the U.S. to fund loan growth. These increases were partially offset by a lower average volume of brokered certificates of deposits and lower cost of interest- bearing deposits resulting from a higher proportion of low-cost deposits both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

Provision for Loan Losses
The following discussion includes the provision for loans previously classified as “covered” as a result of the Shared-Loss Agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of Westernbank Puerto Rico through an FDIC-assisted transaction in 2010 and terminated during the second quarter of 2018.
The Corporation’s provision for loan losses was $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $325.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $97.3 million.
The provision for loan losses for the Puerto Rico segment was $196.5 million, compared to $241.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $45.2 million. This decrease was mainly related to the incremental provision expense of $69.9 million recorded in 2017, based on management’s best estimate of the impact of Hurricanes Irma and María (“the hurricanes”) on the Corporation’s loan portfolios. During 2018, the Corporation recorded downward adjustments to the hurricane-related reserve and released $5.9 million related to the 2018 annual allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) review and recalibration. These positive variances were in part offset by higher Puerto Rico commercial net charge-offs by $43.5 million. The hurricane-related reserve was substantially eliminated during 2018, however, the ALLL balance at December 31, 2018 included $50 million in qualitative judgmental reserves to account for probable losses in the portfolios not embedded in our historical loss rates.
The Popular U.S. segment continued to reflect strong growth and favorable credit quality metrics. The provision for loan losses for this segment amounted to $29.9 million, compared to $77.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $48.0 million mainly related to the taxi medallion portfolio acquired from the FDIC in the assisted sale of Doral Bank, as medallion collateral values significantly decreased during 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of this portfolio was down to $73.4 million from $114.3 million for the same period in 2017. The effect of the annual recalibration was immaterial to the U.S. portfolio.
The Corporation’s provision for loan losses totaled $325.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $170.0 million for 2016, an increase of $155.4 million.
The provision for loan losses for the Puerto Rico segment amounted to $247.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $154.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $92.7 million was mainly related to the $69.9 million incremental provision for the hurricane-related reserve, coupled with higher net charge-offs by $28.4 million, driven by an increase of $13.8 million and $10.6 million in the consumer and mortgage portfolios, respectively, which were impacted by the interruption of payment channels, collection efforts and loss mitigation operations after the hurricanes. The consumer net charge-offs
increase also included the effect of a $7.1 million recovery in 2016 from the sale of previously charged-off credit cards and personal loans.
The provision for loan losses for the U.S. segment amounted to $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $62.6 million was largely related to higher reserves for the U.S. taxi medallion purchased credit impaired portfolio.
Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for a detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, the allowance for loan losses and selected loan losses statistics.
Non-InterestIncome
For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-interest income increased by $233.3 million, when compared with the previous year. Excluding the favorable variance on the FDIC loss share income (expense) of $104.8 million as a result of the Termination Agreement, non-interest income increased by $128.5 million primarily driven by:
• Higher other service fees by $40.8 million mainly due to higher credit card and debit card fees by $22.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively, as a result of higher interchange income resulting from higher transactional volumes; higher other fees by $12.4 million in part due to retail auto loan servicing fees received from Wells Fargo; and higher insurance fees by $3.1 million;
• Higher income from mortgage banking activities by $27.3 million mainly due to lower unfavorable fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights by $28.0 million, net of portfolio amortization;
• The other-than-temporary impairment charge of $8.3 million recorded during the second quarter of 2017 on senior Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (“COFINA”) bonds classified as available-for-sale, which were subsequently sold in the third quarter of 2017;
• Favorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves of $9.4 million related to loans previously sold with credit recourse at BPPR; and
• Higher other operating income by $47.1 million mainly resulting from insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Maria of $19.0 million, modification fees received for the successful completion of loss mitigation alternatives of $14.8 million, $5.5 million in other income related to the Reliable operations mostly associated to recoveries of previously charged-off loans, higher aggregated net earnings from investments under the equity method by $3.9 million and higher daily auto rental revenues.
These favorable variances were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts by $3.0 million mainly due to lower fees on transactional cash management services.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 19

For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income increased by $121.2 million, when compared with the previous year, principally due to:
• Favorable variance in FDIC loss share income (expense) of $197.7 million as a result of a charge of $136.2 million related to the adverse arbitration award recorded during 2016 and lower fair value adjustments to the true-up payment obligation which were mainly impacted by changes in the discount rate.
This positive variance was partially offset by the following:
• Lower service charges on deposit accounts by $7.1 million due to lower transactional cash management services primarily due to the effects of Hurricane Maria;
• Lower other service fees by $17.5 million mainly due lower insurance fees as a result of lower contingency commissions of $7.5 million, lower debit card fees at BPPR due to lower volume of transactions, and lower
credit card fees due to transaction activity and late fee waivers offered as part of the hurricanes relief efforts;
•Lower income from mortgage banking activities by $31.0 million in part due to $9.9 million in lower mortgage servicing fees, which are recognized as loan payments are collected, due to lower mortgage payments from the moratoriums offered as part of the hurricanes relief efforts; higher unfavorable fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights by $11.2 million; and lower net gain on sale of loans;
• Higher other-than-temporary impairment losses on debt securities by $8.1 million due to the previously mentioned other-than-temporary impairment charge of $8.3 million recorded during the second quarter of 2017; and
• Unfavorable variance in gain on loans held-for-sale of $8.7 million as a result of the sale of a non-accrual public sector loan during 2016.

 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $164.4 million, when compared with the previous year, mostly due to:
• Higher personnel cost by $86.2 million, including $1.3 million of direct acquisition costs related to the Reliable transaction, mainly due to $19.5 million recognized in connection with the implementation of the voluntary retirement program and the recognition of $25.5 million related to annual incentives tied to the Corporation’s financial performance; higher commissions, incentives and other bonuses by $19.9 million and higher salaries by $13.1 million;
• Higher equipment expense by $6.6 million due to higher software and maintenance expenses;
• Higher professional fees by $57.4 million mainly due to professional and advisory expenses associated with the termination of the FDIC Shared-Loss Agreements of $8.1 million; higher advisory services by $12.0 million at BPPR for regulatory related initiatives; higher audit and tax services by $2.2 million; higher temporary services by $2.4 million to address certain strategic initiatives; higher programming, processing and other technology expenses by $16.3 million and higher legal fees excluding collections fees by $7.3 million;
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 21

• Higher business promotions by $7.5 million mainly due to higher customer reward program expense and higher advertising cost;
•A loss of $12.5 million resulting from the early extinguishment of the 2019 Notes; and
• Higher other operating expenses by $15.4 million mainly resulting from a $19.6 million write-down related to a capitalized software cost of a technology project discontinued by the Corporation during the third quarter of 2018.
These negative variances were partially offset by:
• Lower OREO expenses by $25.2 million due to lower write-downs on valuation of mortgage, commercial and construction properties by $11.5 million; higher gain on sales by $9.2 million and $3.3 million in insurance reimbursement related to recoveries for hurricane-related claims.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1.6 million, when compared with the previous year, mostly due to:
• Higher net occupancy expenses by $3.5 million due to higher repair and maintenance expense and higher energy costs due to the hurricanes impact;
• Higher equipment expense by $2.9 million due to higher software and maintenance expenses;
• Higher business promotions by $5.4 million mainly due to higher sponsorship, promotion and donations related to disaster relief activities and communications in response to the hurricanes and higher credit card reward expense; and
• Higher other operating expenses by $27.1 million as a result of a write-down of $7.6 million recognized during the first quarter of 2017, related to capitalized software cost for a project that was discontinued by the Corporation; higher sundry losses by $3.6 million; higher provision for unused commitments by $2.6 million; a write-down of $3.6 million on premises and equipment and other costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
These negative variances were partially offset by:
• Lower professional fees by $30.6 million mainly due to lower legal fees related to the FDIC arbitration proceedings, which were resolved during 2016, and lower expenses related to programming, processing and other technology services;
• Lower amortization of intangibles by $2.8 million mainly due to core deposits intangible fully amortized in 2016 at BPPR; and
• A goodwill impairment charge of $3.8 million at the securities subsidiary during 2016, recorded as part of the Corporation’s annual goodwill impairment analysis.
INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense amounted to $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with income tax expense of $230.8 million for the previous year. On December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No. 257 of 2018, which amended the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code to, among other things, reduce the Puerto Rico corporate income tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. The Corporation recognized a $27.7 million non-cash income tax expense as a result of a reduction in the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) related to its Puerto Rico operations, due to the aforementioned reduction in tax rates at which it expects to realize the benefit of the DTA. During 2018, the Corporation also recorded a net tax benefit in connection with the Termination Agreement with the FDIC discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements amounting to $63.9 million, considering the related Tax Closing Agreement. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $168.4 million related to the write down of the DTA of the Corporation’s U.S. operations, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the maximum federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a DTA amounting to $1.0 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.5 billion. The DTA related to the U.S. operations was $0.3 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion.
Refer to Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on DTA balances.
Fourth Quarter Results
The Corporation recognized a net income of $106.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared with a net loss of $102.2 million for the same quarter of 2017.
Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to $476.2 million, compared with $387.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher income from loans acquired as part of the Reliable transaction, higher income from investment securities due to increase in market rates and higher average balances of funds available to invest due to increases in deposit balances, mainly in Puerto Rico. This was partially offset by higher cost of deposits, due to higher average balances as mentioned above.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $42.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to $71.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease of $28.9 million is reflected at PB by $17.9 million mainly related to the taxi medallion portfolio and at BPPR by $11.0 million.
Non-interest income (expense) amounted to $153.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared with $86.1 million for the same quarter in 2017. The positive variance was mainly due to higher other service fees by
22
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

$21.8 million largely impacted by the hurricane-related moratorium of fees offered in 2017 and lower transaction activities at that time, higher mortgage banking activities by $21.2 million mainly due to a favorable variance in the valuation for mortgage servicing rights and higher other operating income by $18.7 million which includes $9.5 million in recoveries from hurricane related claims during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Operating expenses totaled $396.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared with $322.0 million for the same quarter in the previous year. The increase is mainly related to higher personnel costs by $54.7 million due to the impact of the voluntary retirement program and higher incentive compensation, higher professional fees by $9.6 million and the expense of $12.5 million related to the early redemption of the 2019 Notes.
Income tax expense amounted to $84.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared with income tax expense of $182.1 million for the same quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018 the Corporation recognized a $27.7 million non-cash income tax expense as a result of a reduction in the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) related to its Puerto Rico operations, due to the reduction in Corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. The results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include an income tax expense of $168.4 million from the write down of the DTA of the Corporation’s U.S. operations, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the maximum federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS
The Corporation’s reportable segments for managerial reporting purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. A Corporate group has been defined to support the reportable segments. For managerial reporting purposes, the costs incurred by the Corporate group are not allocated to the reportable segments. As discussed in Note 39, management has determined to discontinue this practice effective on January 1, 2019.
For a description of the Corporation’s reportable segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, refer to Note 39 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Corporate group reported a net loss of $89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $60.6 million for the previous year. The increase in the net loss was attributed to the early extinguishment of debt of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the 2019 Notes, higher professional services expense by $6.8 million and higher personnel costs by $12.3 million impacted by the VRP and the profit sharing plan. These negative variances were partially offset by lower borrowing costs by $2.7 million, due to the redemption of the 2019 Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities as discussed in
Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and higher interest income from loans.
Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below:
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment’s net income amounted to $630.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $312.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following:
• Higher net interest income by $202.3 million impacted by higher interest income on money market investments by $59.4 million and investment securities by $69.6 million due to an increase in volume of funds available to invest and to increases in interest rates. In addition, higher income from loans by $120.8 million due to commercial loans growth and the income from the portfolio acquired from Reliable which contributed $89.2 million to interest income, including the amortization of the fair value discount of $28.1 million. These variances were partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits by $49.0 million due mainly to higher average balances. The net interest margin in 2018 was 4.27% compared to 4.32% in the prior year.
• Lower provision for loans losses by $54.6 million driven by the provision related to the estimate of the impact caused by the hurricanes on the Puerto Rico loan portfolios in 2017, for which a downward adjustment was recorded in 2018, and the reserve release related to the allowance for loan losses methodology annual review, discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements;
• Higher non-interest income by $228.8 million mainly due to:
• Higher other service fees by $39.9 million due to higher debit and credit card fees due to higher interchange income resulting from higher transactional volumes and the waivers provided as part of the hurricanes relief efforts in 2017; retail auto loan servicing fees received from Wells Fargo; and higher insurance fees;
• Higher mortgage banking activities by $27.4 million due to a favorable variance in the fair value adjustments of mortgage servicing rights;
• The other-than-temporary impairment charge of $8.3 million recorded during the second quarter of 2017 on senior Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (“COFINA”) bonds

classified as available-for-sale, which were subsequently sold in the third quarter of 2017;
• Favorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves of $9.4 million related to loans previously sold with credit recourse at BPPR;
• Favorable variance in FDIC loss share (expense) income by $104.8 million driven by the impact of the Termination Agreement with the FDIC discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
• Higher other operating income by $41.3 million mainly resulting from insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Maria of $19.0 million and modification fees received for the successful completion of loss mitigation alternatives of $14.8 million,
Partially offset by:
• Lower service charges on deposits accounts by $3.3 million driven by lower transactional cash management fees;
• Higher operating expenses by $119.3 million, mainly due to:
• Higher personnel cost by $59.3 million, including $1.3 million of direct acquisition cost related to the Reliable transaction, mainly due to $19.5 million recognized in connection with the implementation of the voluntary retirement program and the recognition of $21.0 million related to the profit sharing incentive tied to the Corporation’s financial performance;
• Higher equipment expense by $6.4 million due to higher software and maintenance expenses;
• Unfavorable variance of $48.7 million in professional fees due to legal fees related to the FDIC Termination Agreement, higher advisory services related to regulatory related initiatives and higher expenses related to programming, processing and other technology services; and
• Higher business promotions by $7.8 million mainly due to higher customer reward program expense and higher advertising cost;
• Higher other operating expenses by $19.0 million resulting from a $19.6 million write-down related to a capitalized software cost of a technology project discontinued by the Corporation during the third quarter of 2018.
Partially offset by:
• Lower OREO expense by $23.7 million due to lower write-downs on valuation of mortgage,
commercial and construction properties by $11.5 million; higher gain on sales by $7.8 million and $3.3 million in insurance reimbursement related to recoveries for hurricane-related claims.
• Unfavorable variance in income tax expense by $48.5 million mainly due the income tax expense of $27.7 million related to the reduction in Puerto Rico corporate income tax rate from 39% to 37.5%, discussed in Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and higher taxable income, partially offset by the net benefit related to the Termination Agreement with the FDIC of $63 million, considering the related Tax Closing Agreement, as discussed in Note 10.
The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment’s net income amounted to $312.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $230.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following:
• Higher net interest income by $55.1 million impacted by higher interest income on money market investments by $34.2 million due to an increase in volume of funds available to invest, mainly related to an increase in Puerto Rico government deposits, and to recent increases in interest rates. Also, higher interest income on investment securities by $34.7 million driven by higher volumes of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These variances were partially offset by lower interest income on loans by $12.6 million driven by normal portfolio run-off of WB loans, lower average balances of mortgage portfolio due to lower lending activity and waiver of late payments fees; offset by improved yields from commercial and construction portfolio driven by the effect on the variable portfolio of the abovementioned rise in rates. The net interest margin in 2017 was 4.32% compared to 4.61% in the prior year. The reduction in margin is driven by earning asset allocation;
• Higher provision for loans losses by $98.2 million driven by the provision related to the estimate of the impact caused by the hurricanes on the Puerto Rico loan portfolios, higher net charge-offs, mainly in consumer and mortgage portfolios, and the impact of adjusting cash flows of the covered portfolio to reflect the aforementioned payment moratorium. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a decrease related to the allowance for loan losses methodology annual review;
• Higher non-interest income by $120.8 million mainly due to:
• Favorable variance in FDIC loss share (expense) income by $197.7 million driven by the impact of

arbitration award charges of $136.2 million recorded in prior year and by lower fair value adjustment to the true-up payment obligation, which were mainly impacted by changes in the discount rate;
Partially offset by:
Partially offset by:
• Higher net occupancy expense by $3.2 million mostly driven by higher energy costs and higher repairs and maintenance expense associated with hurricanes impact;
• An increase of $2.9 million in business promotions due to higher sponsorship, promotions and donations related to disaster relief activities and communications in response to the hurricanes, and higher credit cards reward expenses;
• Unfavorable variance of $3.1 million in FDIC deposit insurance due to asset growth;
• Higher OREO expense by $3.1 million due to higher write-downs on commercial and mortgage properties and higher mortgage properties expenses; partially offset by a favorable variance in net gains on sale of foreclosed asset; and
• Increase of $24.8 million in other operating expenses driven by a write-down of $7.6 million related to capitalized software cost charged-off on a discontinued project, higher sundry losses by $6.5 million due to higher operational and mortgage servicing losses, and $5.0 million of other costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, including a premises and equipment write-down of $3.6 million;
• Favorable variance in income tax expense by $2.9 million mainly due to a lesser amount of reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions than in previous year.
Popular U.S.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported net income of $77.5 million, compared with a net loss of $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following:
• Higher net interest income by $23.6 million mainly due to higher interest income from loans by $44.9 million principally driven higher volume and yields from commercial and construction loans, partially offset by lower higher interest expense from deposits by $18.7 million driven by higher volume and cost of money market deposits and time deposits. The Popular U.S. reportable segment’s net interest margin was 3.54% for 2018 compared with 3.51% for the same period in 2017;

• Higher operating expenses by $12.6 million driven by higher personnel costs by $7.2 million mainly due to higher salaries and commissions and $2.9 million related to the profit-sharing incentive tied to the Corporation’s financial performance and higher other operating expenses by $3.9 million mainly due to higher reserves for contingencies; and
• Income taxes favorable variance of $166.5 million mainly driven by the partial write-down of $168.4 million recorded in 2017 of the deferred tax asset due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the maximum federal Corporate tax rate.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported net loss of $147.6 million, compared with a net income of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following:
• Higher net interest income by $22.5 million mainly due to higher interest income from loans by $30.5 million principally driven by higher volume from commercial and higher volume and yield from construction loans, and higher interest income from investment securities by $4.6 million due to higher average balances and yield. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower yields from commercial loans and higher interest expense from deposits by $12.4 million driven by higher volume and cost of money market deposits and time deposits. The Popular U.S. reportable segment’s net interest margin was 3.51% for 2017 compared with 3.64% for the same period in 2016;
• Unfavorable variance in the provision for loan losses by $62.7 million driven by portfolio growth, higher net charge-offs and higher reserves for the U.S. taxi medallion purchased credit impaired portfolio;
• Lower non-interest income by $1.2 million mostly due to the reversal of a loan indemnification reserve recorded in 2016;
• Lower operating expenses by $2.7 million driven by a decrease in other operating expenses by $3.5 million due to lower operational losses, and lower OREO expense by $1.6 million due lower commercial properties expenses, including the impact of insurance reimbursements of $1.0 million.

• Income taxes unfavorable variance of $155.0 million mainly driven by the partial write-down of the deferred tax asset because of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Act reduces the maximum federal Corporate tax rate, thus resulting in lower realizable benefit at lower taxable rates.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS Assets
The Corporation’s total assets were $47.6 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $44.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer to the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 included in this 2018 Annual Report.

Debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity amounted to $13.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $10.2 billion at 2017. The increase of $3.2 billion was mainly at BPPR due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by maturities and calls of U.S. agencies and pay-downs of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information with respect to the Corporation’s debt securities AFS and HTM.
Loans

REGULATORY CAPITAL
The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to Popular, Inc. and the Banks, BPPR and PB, are based on the final capital framework of Basel III. The capital rules of Basel III which became effective on January 1, 2015, established a “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) capital measure and specified that

Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 Capital” instruments meeting specified requirements. Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital standards applicable to the Corporation and the Banks were based on Basel I. Table 9 presents the Corporation’s capital adequacy information for the years 2014 through 2018 under the regulatory guidance

 (A) Common equity tier 1 capital measured was introduced by the Basel III Capital Rules which became effective on January 1, 2015. Common equity tier 1 capital is not applicable under the previous Basel 1 capital rules that were applicable in the previous years.
 The increase in the CET1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio on December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was mostly due to the year’s earnings, partially offset by the accelerated common stock repurchase of $125 million and the increase in risk weighted assets driven by the increase in auto loans from the Reliable acquisition. The decrease in leverage ratio compared to 2017 was mainly due to higher average total assets driven by increases in investments in debt securities and the aforementioned increase in auto loans.
An institution is considered “well-capitalized” if it maintains a total capital ratio of 10%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% and a leverage ratio of 5%. The Corporation’s ratios presented in Table 9 show that the Corporation was “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes, the highest classification, under Basel III for years 2015 through 2018 and under Basel I for prior years. BPPR and PB were also well-capitalized for all years presented.
The Basel III Capital Rules also introduce a new 2.5% “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As of January 1, 2019, Popular, BPPR and PB are required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

 The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share, which are presented in the table that follows, are non-GAAP measures. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. Other types of off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in the ordinary course of business include derivatives, operating leases and provision of guarantees, indemnifications, and representation and warranties. Refer to Note 24 for a detailed discussion related to the Corporation’s obligations under credit recourse and representation and warranties arrangements.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The Corporation has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commercial commitments, which require future cash payments on debt and lease agreements. Also, in the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into contractual arrangements whereby it commits to future purchases of products or services from third parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements, whereby the Corporation agrees to purchase products or services with a
30 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time, are defined as purchase obligations.
Purchase obligations include major legal and binding contractual obligations outstanding at the end of 2018, primarily for services, equipment and real estate construction projects. Services include software licensing and maintenance, facilities maintenance, supplies purchasing, and other goods or services used in the operation of the business. Generally, these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually, although in some cases the Corporation has committed to contracts that may extend for several years to secure favorable pricing concessions.
As previously indicated, the Corporation also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive

Under the Corporation’s repurchase agreements, Popular is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s liability on its pension, restoration and postretirement benefit plans amounted to approximately $222 million, compared with $220 million at December 31, 2017. The Corporation’s expected contributions to the pension and benefit restoration plans are minimal, while the expected contributions to the postretirement benefit plan to fund current benefit payment requirements are estimated at $6.5 million for 2019. Obligations to these plans are based on current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plan assets, if applicable, and any participant contributions. Refer to Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these plans. Management believes that the effect of the pension and postretirement plans on liquidity is not significant to the Corporation’s overall financial condition. The BPPR’s non-contributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals.
or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the statement of condition date. The fair value of the contract changes daily as interest rates change. The Corporation may also be required to post additional collateral on margin calls on the derivatives and repurchase transactions.
At December 31, 2018, the aggregate contractual cash obligations, including purchase obligations and borrowings, by maturities, are presented in Table 12.

   At December 31, 2018, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $7.2 million, compared with $7.3 million as of the end of 2017. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Corporation has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. Under the statute of limitations, the liability for uncertain tax positions expires as follows: 2019 - $1.1 million, 2020 - $1.5 million, 2021 - $1.1 million, 2022 - $1.1 million and 2023 - $1.1 million. Additionally, $1.4 million is not subject to the statute of limitations. As a result of examinations, the Corporation anticipates a reduction in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, which could amount to approximately $4.7 million, including interests.
The Corporation also utilizes lending-related financial instruments in the normal course of business to accommodate the financial needs of its customers. The Corporation’s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses credit procedures and
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 31

policies in making those commitments and conditional obligations as it does in extending loans to customers. Since many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring, the total contractual amounts are not representative of the Corporation’s actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements for these commitments.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Market / Interest Rate Risk
The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the Corporation’s capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets and/or liabilities.
Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are securities in the debt securities portfolio classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2018. Other assets subject to market risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $51 million, mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) which amounted to $170 million and securities classified as “trading”, which amounted to $38 million, as of December 31, 2018.
Management believes that market risk is currently not a material source of risk at the Corporation.
Interest Rate Risk (“IRR”)
The Corporation’s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and option risks. In managing interest rate risk, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives.
Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of

  interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations and policy constraints.
Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (“NII”) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and Economic Value of Equity (EVE). The three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the Corporation’s IRR. NII simulation modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-term IRR.
Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs.
Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates, implied forwards, parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures.
The asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the model and processes used to assess IRR are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy.
 32 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect parallel changes of -200, +200 and +400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and deposit elasticity. Thus,
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates. By their nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future. The following table presents the results of the simulations at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

The results of the NII simulations at December 31, 2017 in the table above have been adjusted from those reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-K to align the assumptions used with respect to interest rates on non-maturity public funds deposits to contractual terms of their related depository agreements. Previously, in the Corporation’s Form 10-K the assumptions with respect to such deposits had been based on the historical behavior of commercial and public deposits in the aggregate and did not consider the fact that contracts governing such non-maturity public deposits contained provisions that require BPPR, in certain circumstances, to make adjustments to the interest rate payable on such deposits based upon changes in market interest rates. Although as a result of such adjustment the magnitude of the Corporation’s sensitivity to increases in interest rates became lower at December 31, 2017, the Corporation remained in an asset sensitive position due mainly to, among other reasons: (i) a high level of money market investments that are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, (ii) approximately 34% of the Corporation’s loan portfolio was comprised of Prime and Libor-based loans at December 31,

   2017 and (iii) low elasticity of the Corporation’s core deposit base.
At December 31, 2018, the simulations showed that the Corporation maintains an asset-sensitive position. The overall decrease in sensitivity from December 31, 2017 in the -200, +200 and +400 scenarios is mainly driven by a larger net interest income base due to increases in consumer loans, commercial loans and investment securities and a reduction in money market investments. These effects were partially offset by increases in interest bearing non-maturity deposits, including more elastic public sector deposits, which are more sensitive to increases in market rates.
The Corporation’s loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a third- party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity. Prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten (or lower prepayments could extend) the weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading
The Corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries, BPPR and Popular Securities. Popular Securities’ trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers’ needs related to its retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected short-term price movements. BPPR’s trading activities consist primarily of holding U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as “trading” and hedging the related market risk with “TBA” (to-be-announced) market transactions. The objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from short-term market movements. In addition, BPPR uses forward contracts or TBAs to hedge its securitization pipeline. Risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $38 million, representing approximately 0.1% of the Corporation’s total assets, compared with $34 million and 0.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. As shown in Table 17, the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgage-backed securities which at December 31, 2018 were investment grade securities. As of December 31, 2018, the trading portfolio also included $6 million in U.S. Treasury securities and $0.1 million in Puerto Rico government obligations ($0.3 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2017, respectively). Trading instruments are recognized at fair value, with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices, interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized a net trading account loss of $208 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net trading account loss of $817 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The Corporation’s trading activities are limited by internal policies. For each of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5-day net value-at-risk (“VAR”), with a confidence level of 99%. The VAR measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability.
The Corporation’s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.2 million for the last week in December 31, 2018. There are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with VAR modeling, and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates. Backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses, in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy.
In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the Corporation.
Derivatives
Derivatives may be used by the Corporation as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unexpected fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that are caused by fluctuations in interest rates. Derivative instruments that the Corporation may use include, among others, interest rate swaps, caps, floors, indexed options, and forward contracts. The Corporation does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments in its interest rate risk management strategy. The Corporation enters into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers. Credit risk embedded in these transactions is reduced by requiring appropriate collateral from counterparties and entering into netting agreements whenever possible. All outstanding derivatives are recognized in the Corporation’s consolidated statement of condition at their fair value. Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Corporation’s involvement in derivative instruments and hedging activities.
The Corporation’s derivative activities are entered primarily to offset the impact of market volatility on the economic value
  36 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT
of assets or liabilities. The net effect on the market value of potential changes in interest rates of derivatives and other financial instruments is analyzed. The effectiveness of these hedges is monitored to ascertain that the Corporation is reducing market risk as expected. Derivative transactions are generally executed with instruments with a high correlation to the hedged asset or liability. The underlying index or instrument of the derivatives used by the Corporation is selected based on its similarity to the asset or liability being hedged. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, fixed and variable interest rate hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in fair value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation is expected to be substantially offset by the Corporation’s gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged assets and liabilities. Management will assess if circumstances warrant liquidating or replacing the derivatives position in the hypothetical event that high correlation is reduced. Based on the Corporation’s derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2018, it is not anticipated that such a scenario would have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial condition or results of operations.
Certain derivative contracts also present credit risk and liquidity risk because the counterparties may not comply with the terms of the contract, or the collateral obtained might be illiquid or become so. The Corporation controls credit risk through approvals, limits and monitoring procedures, and through master netting and collateral agreements whenever possible. Further, as applicable under the terms of the master agreements, the Corporation may obtain collateral, where appropriate, to reduce credit risk. The credit risk attributed to the counterparty’s nonperformance risk is incorporated in the fair value of the derivatives. Additionally, as required by the fair value measurements guidance, the fair value of the Corporation’s own credit standing is considered in the fair value of the derivative liabilities. For information on the gain (loss) resulting from the inclusion of the credit risk in the fair value of the derivatives, refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Corporation performs appropriate due diligence and monitors the financial condition of counterparties that represent a significant volume of credit exposure. Additionally, the Corporation has exposure limits to prevent any undue funding exposure.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Corporation manages the variability of cash payments due to interest rate fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and that are linked to specified hedged assets and liabilities. The cash flow hedges relate to forward contracts or TBA mortgage-backed securities that are sold and bought for future settlement to hedge mortgage- backed securities and loans prior to securitization. The seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. These securities are hedging a forecasted transaction and are designated for cash flow hedge accounting. The notional amount of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2018 amounted to $ 90 million (2017 - $ 99 million).
Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative information on these derivative contracts.
Fair Value Hedges
The Corporation did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Trading and Non-Hedging Derivative Activities
The Corporation enters into derivative positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets mostly to economically hedge a related asset or liability. The Corporation also enters into various derivatives to provide these types of derivative products to customers. These free-standing derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as part of the results of operations for the period.
Following is a description of the most significant of the Corporation’s derivative activities that are not designated for hedge accounting. Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative and qualitative information on these derivative instruments.
The Corporation has over-the-counter option contracts which are utilized in order to limit the Corporation’s exposure on customer deposits whose returns are tied to the S&P 500 or to certain other equity securities or commodity indexes. The Corporation offers certificates of deposit with returns linked to these indexes to its retail customers, principally in connection with individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2018, these deposits amounted to $63 million (2017 - $ 66 million), or less than 1% (2017 – less than 1%) of the Corporation’s total deposits. In these
certificates, the customer’s principal is guaranteed by the Corporation and insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law. The instruments pay a return based on the increase of these indexes, as applicable, during the term of the instrument. Accordingly, this product gives customers the opportunity to invest in a product that protects the principal invested but allows the customer the potential to earn a return based on the performance of the indexes.
The risk of issuing certificates of deposit with returns tied to the applicable indexes is economically hedged by the Corporation. Indexed options are purchased from financial institutions with strong credit standings, whose return is designed to match the return payable on the certificates of deposit issued. By hedging the risk in this manner, the effective cost of these deposits is fixed. The contracts have a maturity and an index equal to the terms of the pool of retail deposits that they are economically hedging.
The purchased option contracts are initially accounted for at cost (i.e., amount of premium paid) and recorded as a derivative asset. The derivative asset is marked-to-market on a quarterly basis with changes in fair value charged to earnings. The deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded options that must be bifurcated in accordance with the derivatives and hedging activities guidance.
The initial value of the embedded option (component of the deposit contract that pays a return based on changes in the applicable indexes) is bifurcated from the related certificate of deposit and is initially recorded as a derivative liability and a corresponding discount on the certificate of deposit is recorded. Subsequently, the discount on the deposit is accreted and included as part of interest expense while the bifurcated option is marked-to-market with changes in fair value charged to earnings.
The purchased indexed options are used to economically hedge the bifurcated embedded option. These option contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore, cannot be designated as accounting hedges. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of the indexed options on deposits approximated $ 69 million (2017 - $ 70 million) with a fair value of $ 13 million (asset) (2017 - $ 16 million) while the embedded options had a notional value of $ 63 million (2017 - $ 66 million) with a fair value of $ 11 million (liability) (2017 - $ 14 million).
Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other non-hedging derivative activities utilized by the Corporation during 2018 and 2017.
Foreign Exchange
The Corporation holds an interest in BHD León in the Dominican Republic, which is an investment accounted for under the equity method. The Corporation’s carrying value of the equity interest in BHD León approximated $144 million at December 31, 2018. This business is conducted in the country’s
  POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 37

foreign currency. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment, from operations for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of condition, except for highly-inflationary environments in which the effects would be included in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had approximately $50 million in an unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss, compared with an unfavorable adjustment of $43 million at December 31, 2017 and $40 million at December 31, 2016.
Liquidity
The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations, finance expected future growth and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions. The Board is responsible for establishing the Corporation’s tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the RMC and the ALCO. The management of liquidity risk, on a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation’s Corporate Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the Board and for monitoring the Corporation’s liquidity position on an ongoing basis. Also, the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies.
An institution’s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, its credit rating is downgraded, it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding.
Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The Corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the Corporation’s liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how
the market and customers might react to every event, and are dependent on many assumptions.
Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered deposits and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, funding 83% of the Corporation’s total assets at December 31, 2018 and 80% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 67% at December 31, 2018, compared to 70% at December 31, 2017. In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018. A detailed description of the Corporation’s borrowings, including their terms, is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation’s cash inflows and outflows.
As previously mentioned, the Corporation executed several actions corresponding to its capital and liquidity strategic plans. These include the redemption by Popular North America of all outstanding 8.327% Capital Securities, Series A issued by BanPonce Trust I, which had an aggregate liquidation amount of $52.9 million; entering into an accelerated share repurchase plan of $125 million; and the issuance of $300 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023, the proceeds of which, along with cash-on-hand, were used to redeem $450 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2019, on October 15, 2018. Refer to additional details of these transactions in the Overview section of this MD&A and to Notes 19, Borrowings, and 21, Stockholder’s Equity, to the accompanying financial statements.
The following sections provide further information on the Corporation’s major funding activities and needs, as well as the risks involved in these activities. Note 41 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides consolidating statements of condition, of operations and of cash flows which separately presents the Corporation’s bank holding companies and its subsidiaries as part of the “All other subsidiaries and eliminations” column.
Banking Subsidiaries
Primary sources of funding for the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries (BPPR and PB), or “the banking subsidiaries,” include retail and commercial deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities, mortgage loan securitization, and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Board (the “FRB”), and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to quickly raise funds under these facilities.
Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information of the Corporation’s borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries.
 38 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations, investment portfolio purchases, loan purchases and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios, and operational expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments, recourse provisions, servicing advances, derivatives, credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by BPPR.
The banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits.
The Corporation’s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings (by nationally recognized credit rating agencies), and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or
the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.
Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 8 for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under $100,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations under $100,000. Core deposits have historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $ 34.9 billion, or 88% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018, compared with $30.9 billion, or 87% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017. Core deposits financed 79% of the Corporation’s earning assets at December 31, 2018, compared with 76% at December 31, 2017.
The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $100,000 and over at December 31, 2018 is presented in the table that follows:

       POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 39

The Corporation had $ 0.5 billion in brokered deposits at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which financed approximately 1%, of its total assets. In the event that any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries’ regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a well-capitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder the Corporation’s ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts.
At December 31, 2018, management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the Corporation’s financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate. The Corporation’s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if its banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally, if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected.
Bank Holding Companies
The principal sources of funding for the bank holding companies (the “BHC’s”), which are Popular, Inc. (holding company only) (“PIHC”) and PNA, include cash on hand, investment securities, dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries (subject to regulatory limits and authorizations) asset sales, credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings.
The principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt, and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest (related to trust preferred securities) and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries.
The BHC’s have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries, however, the cash needs of the
Corporation’s non-banking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal. These sources of funding have become more costly due to the reductions in the Corporation’s credit ratings. The Corporation’s principal credit ratings are below “investment grade”, which affects the Corporation’s ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities.
The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHC’s amounted to $679 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $886 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease is related to the redemption of Senior Notes, as mentioned above.
The contractual maturities of the BHC’s notes payable at December 31, 2018 are presented in Table 20.

Later years
(In thousands)
$294,039 384,875
  Total $678,914
The BHCs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all BHCs obligations during the foreseeable future.
Non-banking subsidiaries
The principal sources of funding for the non-banking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations, loan sales, repurchase agreements, capital injection and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies. The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment of dividends to the BHCs. The liquidity needs of the non-banking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings from their holding companies, BPPR or PB.
Dividends
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation declared quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock of $0.25 per share, for a total of $101.3 million. The dividends for the Corporation’s Series A and Series B preferred stock amounted to $3.7 million. The BHC’s received dividends amounting to $446 million from BPPR, $8 million in dividends from its non-banking subsidiaries, $1 million in dividends from EVERTEC’s parent company, $6 million from an investment in an equity investee and $13 million in dividend from its
    40 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

investment in BHD Leon. A portion of these dividends was used by Popular, Inc. for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock, the $125 million accelerated stock repurchase, to partially fund the redemption of $450 million, 7% senior notes and the redemption of $53 million in trust preferred securities.
On January 23, 2019, the Corporation announced an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, subject to approval by its Board of Directors. On February 15, 2019, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on its outstanding common stock, payable on April 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2019.
Other Funding Sources and Capital
The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements. The Corporation’s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government investment securities, sponsored U.S. agency securities, government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets. The availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation’s unpledged debt securities, amounted to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017. A substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing quickly in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources.
Additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities, prepayments and sales. The loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets. In particular, mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the Corporation could use.
Risks to Liquidity
Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis. Some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors. Derivatives, such as those embedded in long-term repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps, and off-balance sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities.
The importance of the Puerto Rico market for the Corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its
financing activities. In the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, the credit quality of the Corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs. The Puerto Rico economy continues to face various challenges, including significant pressures in some sectors of the residential real estate market and the impact of two major hurricanes in September 2017. Refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of this MD&A for some highlights on the current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis.
Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. In order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario, management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable. These plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms, such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the FHLB and the FRB.
The credit ratings of Popular’s debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the Corporation’s ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost and access to funding sources. Credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management, geographic concentration in Puerto Rico, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Corporation’s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors.
The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation’s overall credit ratings.
Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements
The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $10 million in deposits at December 31, 2018 that are subject to rating triggers.
In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, as discussed in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements
    POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 41

require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution’s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $62 million at December 31, 2018. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation’s liquidity resources and impact its operating results.
Credit Risk
Geographic and Government Risk
The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. The Corporation’s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 39 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the “Commonwealth” or “Puerto Rico”), which has endured a decade-long recession and continues to face severe economic and fiscal challenges.
Economic Performance
The Commonwealth’s economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, and the Commonwealth’s gross national product (“GNP”) has contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between 2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the “Planning Board”) estimates, published in April 2018, the Commonwealth’s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 2.4% and 5.6%, respectively. The Planning Board estimates that real GNP will increase approximately 3.5% in fiscal year 2019, in part due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments in connection with Hurricane Maria. For information regarding the economic projections of the Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan, see Fiscal Plans, Commonwealth Fiscal Plan, below.
Fiscal Crisis
The Commonwealth remains in the midst of a profound fiscal crisis affecting the central government and many of its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities. This fiscal crisis has been primarily the result of economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. As a result of the crisis, the Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have been unable to make debt service payments on their outstanding bonds and notes since 2016. The escalating fiscal
and economic crisis and the imminent widespread defaults prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in June 2016, which, as further discussed below, established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities. The Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring their debts through such mechanisms.
PROMESA
PROMESA created a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the “Oversight Board”) with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets, in accordance with modified accrual accounting, are produced for at least four consecutive years. In August 2016, President Obama appointed the seven voting members of the Oversight Board through the process established in PROMESA, which authorized the President to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders. On February 15, 2019, however, the First Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals (the “First Circuit”) declared such appointments unconstitutional on the grounds that they did not comply with the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires that principal federal officers be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The First Circuit’s decision provides that its mandate will not issue for 90 days, so as to allow the President and the U.S. Senate to validate the currently defective appointments or reconstitute the Oversight Board in accordance with the Appointments Clause. Such process may delay the Commonwealth’s efforts to restructure its debts and create additional uncertainty regarding the Commonwealth’s prospects for fiscal and economic recovery.
The Oversight Board has designated the Commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities as “covered entities” under PROMESA. None of the Commonwealth’s municipalities have been designated as covered entities as of the date of this report but may be designated as such in the future. Covered entities are required to submit their annual budgets and, if the Oversight Board so requests, their fiscal plans, to the Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also required to seek Oversight Board approval to issue, guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of $10 million or more. Finally, covered entities are also potentially eligible to avail themselves of the restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. One of such restructuring processes, Title VI, is a largely out-of-court process through which a government entity and its financial creditors can agree on terms to restructure such entity’s debt. If
 42 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

a supermajority of creditors of a certain category agrees, that agreement can bind all other creditors in such category. The other one, Title III, draws on the federal bankruptcy code and provides a court-supervised process for a comprehensive restructuring led by the Oversight Board. Access to either of these procedures is dependent on compliance with certain requirements established in PROMESA, including the approval of the Oversight Board.
Fiscal Plans
Commonwealth Fiscal Plan. The Oversight Board has certified several versions of fiscal plans for the Commonwealth since 2017. The most recent fiscal plan for the Commonwealth certified by the Oversight Board is dated as of October 23, 2018 (the “Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan”). The Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan estimates an 8.0% contraction in real GNP in fiscal year 2018, after accounting for the impact of disaster relief funding and the measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan. It also projects that disaster relief spending will have a short-term stimulative effect on the economy, which, combined with the estimated effects of the proposed fiscal measures and structural reforms, will result in variable GNP growth from fiscal years 2019 through 2022, followed by GNP contraction in fiscal year 2023 as disaster relief funding drops off considerably. The Commonwealth’s population is estimated to steadily decline at a rate of approximately 1% annually through the projection period.
Before accounting for the impact of the measures and structural reforms contemplated therein, the Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan projects a pre-contractual debt service surplus in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. This surplus is not projected to continue after fiscal year 2020, as federal disaster relief funding slows down. The Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan projects that, without major Government action, the Commonwealth would suffer an annual primary deficit starting in fiscal year 2021. After the application of the fiscal measures and structural reforms contemplated therein, the Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan projects a pre-contractual debt service surplus of approximately $17 billion from fiscal years 2018 through 2023. However, after the payment of contractual debt service, the surplus projected for such period drops significantly and annual deficits begin in fiscal year 2027. Moreover, even after the implementation of the fiscal measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan and before contractual debt service, the Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan projects an annual deficit starting in fiscal year 2034. Based on such long-term projections, the Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan concludes that the Commonwealth cannot afford to meet all of its contractual debt obligations.
The Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan does not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of the Commonwealth’s municipalities. It does, however, contemplate the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of budgetary subsidies
provided by the Commonwealth to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities were reduced by $150 million in fiscal year 2018 and by an additional $45 million in 2019 (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $220 million in fiscal year 2018 and approximately $175 in fiscal year 2019). The Revised Commonwealth Fiscal Plan provides for additional reductions in such appropriations every fiscal year, holding appropriations constant at approximately 45-50% of current levels starting in fiscal year 2022, before ultimately phasing out all subsidies in fiscal year 2024.
Other Fiscal Plans. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities. Such plans conclude that such entities cannot afford to meet all of their contractual obligations as currently scheduled.
The certified fiscal plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (“PREPA”), Puerto Rico’s electric power utility, contemplates the transformation of Puerto Rico’s electric system through, among other things, the establishment of a public- private partnership with respect to PREPA’s transmission and distribution system, and calls for significant structural reforms at PREPA. The plan also contemplates changes to the treatment of the municipal contribution in lieu of taxes, which could result in increased electricity expenses for municipalities.
The certified fiscal plan for Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (“GDB”) contemplated the wind-down of GDB and the distribution of the cash flows of GDB’s loan portfolio among its creditors (including its municipal depositors) through a debt restructuring proceeding under Title VI of PROMESA. Such restructuring was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (the “U.S. District Court”) and subsequently consummated on November 29, 2018.
Pending Title III and Title VI Proceedings
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court to restructure the Commonwealth’s liabilities under Title III of PROMESA. The Oversight Board has subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (“COFINA”), the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority and PREPA.
On October 19, 2018, the Oversight Board filed a plan of adjustment for COFINA (as subsequently amended, the “COFINA Plan of Adjustment”), as well as a motion to approve a settlement of certain disputes between the Commonwealth and COFINA regarding the ownership of a portion of the sales and use tax pledged to the payment of COFINA’s bonds (the “COFINA Settlement”). The COFINA Plan of Adjustment provided for the restructuring of COFINA’s bonds based on the COFINA Settlement, which contemplated that the Commonwealth would
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 43

receive approximately 46.35% of the yearly revenues previously allocated to COFINA. The COFINA Settlement and the COFINA Plan of Adjustment were confirmed by the U.S. District Court on February 4, 2019 and the restructuring transaction contemplated thereby was consummated on February 12, 2019. As of the date of this report, the plans of adjustment for the other Title III debtors have not been filed.
Exposure of the Corporation
The credit quality of BPPR’s loan portfolio reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. While PROMESA provides a process to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis, the length and complexity of the Title III proceedings for the Commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities, the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans and the long- term impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria present significant economic risks. In addition, the measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that will have to be taken in the near future will likely affect many of our individual customers and customers’ businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect consumer confidence. This, in turn, could result in reductions in consumer spending that may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable to adequately manage the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic challenges, including by consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation’s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities totaled to $458 million and $484 million, respectively, which amounts were fully outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Further deterioration of the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic situation, could adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $413 million consists of loans and $45 million are securities ($435 million and $49 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017). Substantially all of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2018 were obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these were “general obligations” of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or “special obligations” of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At December 31, 2018 75% of the Corporation’s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan,
Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayamón. Although the Oversight Board has not designated any of the Commonwealth’s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA, it may decide to do so in the future. For a more detailed description of the Corporation’s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note 25 – Commitments and contingencies.
In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $368 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($386 million at December 31, 2017). These included $293 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (“HFA”), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2017 - $310 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and subsequent foreclosure of the underlying property. The Corporation also had at December 31, 2018, $45 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and subsequent foreclosure of the underlying property (December 31, 2017 - $44 million). In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA’s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, he has not exercised this power as of the date hereof. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $7 million in securities issued by HFA that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of U.S. agencies and Treasury obligations have been escrowed (December 31, 2017 - $7 million), and $23 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non-governmental parties (December 31, 2017 - $25 million).
BPPR’s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and the ongoing Title III proceedings under PROMESA described above. Similarly, BPPR’s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to current and former government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits.
BPPR also has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The
44 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships.
United States Virgin Islands
The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the “USVI”) and has credit exposure to USVI government entities.
The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations, and was also severely impacted by Hurricanes Irma and María. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities.
To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $76 million, of which $68 million is outstanding (compared to $82 million and $73 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017). Of the amount outstanding, approximately (i) $42 million represents loans to the West Indian Company LTD, a government-owned company that owns and operates a cruise ship pier and shopping mall complex in St. Thomas, (ii) $14 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority, a public corporation of the USVI that operates USVI’s water production and electric generation plants, and (iii) $12 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, a public corporation of the USVI created for the purpose of raising capital for public projects (compared to $43 million, $14 million and $16 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017).
U.S. Government
As further detailed in Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation’s investment securities represented exposure to the U.S. Government in the form of U.S. Government sponsored entities, as well as agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.2 billion of residential mortgages and $74 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies at December 31, 2018 (compared to $1.7 billion and $88 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017).
Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets include primarily past-due loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans, and real estate
property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 21. Credit metrics for 2017 were impacted by the relief initiatives implemented by the Corporation related to the hurricanes, including the loan payment moratorium.
Overall, the Puerto Rico segment continued to reflect a positive credit quality trend during 2018, with metrics better than, or improving to levels equal to, those prevailing prior to the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. The Corporation continues to closely monitor its portfolios and related credit metrics given Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic and fiscal challenges.
The results of the U.S. operations also remained solid with strong growth and favorable credit quality metrics. The U.S. taxi medallion portfolio acquired from the FDIC in the assisted sale of Doral Bank continued to reflect the pressure on medallion collateral values, particularly in the New York City metro area.
Total non-performing assets (“NPAs”) increased by $5 million when compared with December 31, 2017. The Puerto Rico operations reflect an increase in non-performing loans (“NPLs”) of $53 million, as the prior year included the impact of the moratorium offered to our clients as part of the hurricane relief efforts, coupled with additions of $13 million related to the Reliable auto business. The increase in Puerto Rico NPLs was offset by lower other real estate owned by $53 million related to increased sales activity, and lower inflows as a result of the temporary suspension of foreclosures after the hurricanes. The U.S. operations NPLs increased by $3 million, principally driven by the classification as non-performing of a single construction borrower.
At December 31, 2018, NPLs secured by real estate, amounted to $459 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $49 million in the U.S. operations, compared to $449 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $36 million in the U.S. operations at December 31, 2017.
The Corporation’s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate (“CRE”), amounted to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018, of which $2.0 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, compared with $7.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2017. CRE non-performing loans, amounted to $129 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $124 million at December 31, 2017. The CRE non-performing loans ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 3.05% and 0.02%, respectively, at December 31, 2018, compared with 2.77% and 0.10%, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
In addition to the NPLs included in Table 21, at December 31, 2018, there were $153 million of performing loans, mostly commercial loans, which in management’s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing and are considered impaired (December 31, 2017 - $155 million).

   [1] The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at the Popular U.S. reportable segment.
[2] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
[3] The amount consists of $3 million in non-performing loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 and $20 million in covered OREO at December 31, 2017
and $4 million and $32 million at December 31, 2016, respectively. It excludes covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 as they are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method, in which these loans will accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loans using estimated cash flow analyses.
[4] The carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 that are contractually 90 days or more past due was $216 million at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $272 million; December 31, 2016 - $282 million). This amount is excluded from the above table as the loans’ accretable yield interest recognition is independent from the underlying contractual loan delinquency status.
[5] It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans includes $134 million at December 31, 2018 related to the rebooking of loans previously pooled into GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back option as further described below (December 31, 2017 - $840 million). These balances include $283 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $178 million; December 31, 2016 - $181 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $69 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation’s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2017 - $58 million; December 31, 2016 - $68 million).
[6] These asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of covered loans. Appropriate adjustments to the numerator and denominator have been reflected in the calculation of these ratios. Management believes the inclusion of acquired loans in certain asset quality ratios that include non-performing assets, past due loans or net charge-offs in the numerator and denominator results in distortions of these ratios and they may not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that were not impacted by purchase accounting.

      [1] The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at the Popular U.S. reportable segment.
[2] Non-performing loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015 consist of $45 million in commercial loans and $95 thousand in construction loans. Non-performing loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2014 consist of $14 million in mortgage loans, $309 thousand in commercial loans and $4.5 million in consumer loans.
[3] The amount consists of $4 million in non-performing loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 and $37 million in covered OREO at December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014 - $18 million and $130 million, respectively). It excludes covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 as they are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method, in which these loans will accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loans using estimated cash flow analyses.
[4] The carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 that are contractually 90 days or more past due was $349 million at December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014 - $516 million). This amount is excluded from the above table as the loans’ accretable yield interest recognition is independent from the underlying contractual loan delinquency status.
[5] It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. These balances include $164 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014 - $125 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $70 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation’s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets.

 Loan Delinquencies
Another key measure used to evaluate and monitor the Corporation’s asset quality is loan delinquencies. Loans delinquent 30 days or more and delinquencies, as a percentage
of their related portfolio category at December 31, 2018 and 2017, are presented below.

Inflows of non-performing loans held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment increased by $7 million, or 22%, from the same period in 2017, mostly driven by higher construction inflows of $18 million, partially offset by lower mortgage inflows of $9 million.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”)
The allowance for loan and lease losses, which represents management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation’s management evaluates the adequacy of the ALLL for loan losses on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current economic conditions and the resulting impact on Popular Inc.’s loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio by loan type and risk characteristics, historical loss experience, results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans, regulatory requirements and loan impairment measurement, among other factors.
The Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management’s estimates are the years of historical data when estimating losses, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements,

among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Consequently, the business financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could also be affected. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies / Estimates section of this MD&A for a description of the Corporation’s ALLLmethodology.
At December 31, 2018, the ALLL amounted to $569 million, a decrease of $54 million when compared with December 31, 2017. The provision for loan losses for the non-covered portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $226 million, compared to $320 million in the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $94 million. The third quarter of 2017 included a charge of $64.3 million related to hurricane María’s estimated impact on the Puerto Rico loan portfolios, coupled with downward adjustments to the hurricane-related reserve during 2018, as portfolios performed better than the assumptions used to create this reserve. Refer to the Provision for Loan Losses section of this MD&A for additional information.

 Troubled debt restructurings
The Corporation’s TDR loans amounted to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, increasing by $258 million, or approximately 20%, from December 31, 2017, driven by higher commercial and mortgage TDRs in the BPPR segment of $140 million and $113 million, respectively. TDRs in accruing status increased by $172 million from December 31, 2017, while non-accruing TDRs increased by $86 million.
Refer to Note 9 for additional information on modifications considered troubled debt restructurings, including certain qualitative and quantitative data about troubled debt restructurings performed in the past twelve months.
The following tables present the approximate amount and percentage of non-covered commercial impaired loans for which the Corporation relied on appraisals dated more than one year old for purposes of impairment requirements at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Appraisals may be adjusted due to their age and the type, location and condition of the property, area or general market conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date of the appraisal and the impairment measurement date. Refer to the Allowance for Loan Losses section of Note 2, “Summary of significant accounting policies” for additional information.

Enterprise Risk and Operational Risk Management
The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division (the “FORM Division”) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, as well as developing and overseeing the implementation of risk programs and reporting that facilitate a broad integrated view of risks. The FORM Division also leads the ongoing development of a strong risk management culture and the framework that support effective risk governance. For new products and initiatives, the Corporate Compliance Division has put in place processes to ensure that an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new product or initiative. Similar procedures are followed with the Treasury Division for transactions involving the purchase and sale of assets.
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways, including errors, fraud, cyber attacks, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, and failure to perform in a timely manner, among others. These events can potentially result in financial losses and other damages to the Corporation, including reputational harm. The successful management of operational risk is particularly important to a diversified financial services company like Popular because of the nature, volume and complexity of its various businesses.
To monitor and control operational risk and mitigate related losses, the Corporation maintains a system of comprehensive policies and controls. The Corporation’s Operational Risk Committee (ORCO) and the Cyber Security Committee which are composed of senior level representatives from the business lines and corporate functions, provide executive oversight to facilitate consistency of effective policies, best practices, controls and monitoring tools for managing and assessing all types of operational risks across the Corporation. The FORM Division, within the Corporation’s Risk Management Group, serves as ORCO’s operating arm and is responsible for establishing baseline processes to measure, monitor, limit and manage operational risk. In addition, the Auditing Division provides oversight about policy compliance and ensures adequate attention is paid to correct the identified issues.
Effective May 2018, the Corporation created the Corporate Security Group (“CSG”) , under the direction of the Chief Security Officer (“CSO”). The CSG now leads all efforts pertaining to cyber and technology related security safeguards and enterprise fraud. The CSG is also responsible for the development and oversight of policies and programs intended for the mitigation and/or reduction of compliance, operational, strategic, financial and reputational risk strategies relating to the protection of data and Corporate assets. The CSG oversees and coordinates fraud and cyber security efforts and controls across the Corporation’s various units,and leads the Cyber Security Committee.
Operational risks fall into two major categories: business specific and corporate-wide affecting all business lines. The
primary responsibility for the day-to-day management of business specific risks relies on business unit managers. Accordingly, business unit managers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate risk containment measures, including corporate-wide or business segment specific policies and procedures, controls and monitoring tools, are in place to minimize risk occurrence and loss exposures. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, transaction processing monitoring and analysis and contingency plans for systems interruptions. To manage corporate-wide risks, specialized functions, such as Legal, Cyber Security, Business Continuity and Outsourcing Risk Management, and Finance and Compliance, among others, assist the business units in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses.
Operational risk management plays a different role in each category. For business specific risks, the FORM Division works with the segments to ensure consistency in policies, processes, and assessments. With respect to corporate-wide risks, such as cyber and information security, business continuity and outsourcing risk management, legal and compliance, the risks are assessed, and a consolidated corporate view is developed and communicated to the business level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. We continually monitor the system of internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. An additional level of review is applied to current and potential regulation and its impact on business processes, to ensure that appropriate controls are put in place to address regulation requirements.
Today’s threats to customer information and information systems are complex, more wide spread, continually emerging, and increasing at a rapid pace. The Corporation continuously monitors these threats and, to date, we have not experienced any material losses as a result of cyber attacks.

Adjusted net income – Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The Corporation prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or the “reported basis”). In addition to analyzing the Corporation’s results on a reported basis, management monitors the “Adjusted net income” of the Corporation and excludes from such calculation the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. Management believes that the “Adjusted net income” provides
54 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

meaningful information to investors about the underlying performance of the Corporation’s ongoing operations. “Adjusted net income” is a non-GAAP financial measure.
The following tables describes adjustments to net income for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Refer to Note 10 - FDIC Loss-Share Asset and True Up Payment Obligation for additional information.
[2] Represents the impact of the Termination Agreement on income taxes. In June 2012, the Corporation entered into a Tax Closing Agreement with the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury to clarify the tax treatment related to the loans acquired in the FDIC Transaction in accordance with the provisions of the Puerto Rico Tax Code. Based on the provisions of this Tax Closing Agreement, the Corporation recognized a net income tax benefit of $108.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 37 - Income Taxes for additional information.
[3] On December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No.257 of 2018, which amended the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, to among other things, reduce the Puerto Rico corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. The resulting adjustments reduced the DTA related to the Corporation’s P.R. operations as a result of a lower realizable benefit at the lower tax rate. Refer to Note 37 - Income Taxes for additional information.

 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 61

 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of Popular, Inc. (the “Corporation”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for our assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and includes controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporation’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The management of Popular, Inc. has assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
On August 1, 2018 the Corporation completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities from Reliable Financial Services, Inc. and Reliable Finance Holding Co. (“Reliable”), subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company related to their auto finance business in Puerto Rico. The Reliable business’ total assets and total revenues represented approximately 4% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2018. The Corporation has excluded the acquired business from its assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2018. The Corporation made this determination in accordance with the SEC’s guidance which permits the exclusion of a recently acquired business from the scope of this assessment in the year of acquisition.
Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on the criteria referred to above.
The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, as stated in their report dated March 1, 2019 which appears herein.

62 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Popular, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Popular, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the Reliable business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 because it was acquired by the Corporation in a purchase business combination during 2018. We have also excluded the Reliable business from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Reliable is a wholly owned business of the Corporation whose total assets and total
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 63

revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 4% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management’s assessment and our audit of Popular, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting also included controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1 - Nature of operations
Popular, Inc. (the “Corporation or “Popular”) is a diversified, publicly owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the mainland United States and U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services, through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (“BPPR”), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto and equipment leasing and financing, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (“PB”), which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and Florida. Prior to April 9, 2018, PB operated under the legal name of Banco Popular North America and conducted business under the assumed name of Popular Community Bank. Note 39 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation’s business segments.
Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies
The accounting and financial reporting policies of Popular, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with prevailing practices within the financial services industry.
The following is a description of the most significant of these policies:
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Popular, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities, the Corporation would also consolidate any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which it has a controlling financial interest; and therefore, it is the primary beneficiary. Assets held in a fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and, accordingly, are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Unconsolidated investments, in which there is at least 20% ownership and the Corporation exercises significant influence, are generally accounted for by the equity method with earnings recorded in other operating income. These investments are included in other assets and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income. Those investments in which there is less than 20% ownership, are generally carried under the cost method of accounting, unless significant influence is exercised. Under the cost method, the Corporation recognizes income when dividends are received. Limited partnerships are accounted for by the
equity method unless the investor’s interest is so “minor” that the limited partner may have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial policies.
Statutory business trusts that are wholly-owned by the Corporation and are issuers of trust preferred securities are not consolidated in the Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Under this method, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date the acquirer obtains control. Also, assets or liabilities arising from noncontractual contingencies are measured at their acquisition date at fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or liability. Acquisition-related restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria of exit or disposal activities are expensed as incurred. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Changes in income tax valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets are recognized in earnings subsequent to the measurement period as an adjustment to income tax expense. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. The changes in fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in earnings unless the arrangement is a hedging instrument for which changes are initially recognized in other comprehensive income.
On August 1, 2018, Popular, Inc., through its subsidiary Popular Auto, LLC, acquired and assumed from Reliable Financial Services, Inc. and Reliable Finance Holding Co. (“Reliable”), subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company, certain assets and liabilities related to their auto finance business in Puerto Rico (the “Reliable Transaction” or “Transaction”). The Corporation determined that this acquisition constituted a business combination as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805 “Business Combinations”. Refer to Note 4, Business combination, for further details on the Reliable Transaction.
There were no significant business combinations during 2017 and 2016.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 71

Fair value measurements
The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value framework established in the guidance for Fair Value Measurements in ASC Subtopic 820-10, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value which are (1) quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, (2) observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, and (3) unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
The guidance in ASC Subtopic 820-10 also addresses measuring fair value in situations where markets are inactive and transactions are not orderly. Transactions or quoted prices for assets and liabilities may not be determinative of fair value when transactions are not orderly, and thus, may require adjustments to estimate fair value. Price quotes based on transactions that are not orderly should be given little, if any, weight in measuring fair value. Price quotes based on transactions that are orderly shall be considered in determining fair value, and the weight given is based on facts and circumstances. If sufficient information is not available to determine if price quotes are based on orderly transactions, less weight should be given to the price quote relative to other transactions that are known to be orderly.
Investment securities
Investment securities are classified in four categories and accounted for as follows:
• Debt securities that the Corporation has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as debt securities held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. The Corporation may not sell or transfer held-to-maturity securities without calling into question its intent to hold other debt securities to maturity, unless a nonrecurring or unusual event that could not have been reasonably anticipated has occurred. An investment in debt securities is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. For other-than-temporary impairments, the Corporation assesses if it has both the intent and the ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in its fair value to its amortized cost. An other-than-temporary impairment not related to a credit loss (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows
expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) for a held-to-maturity security is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized over the remaining life of the debt security. The amortized cost basis for a debt security is adjusted by the credit loss amount of other-than-temporary impairments.
• Debt securities classified as trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in non-interest income.
• Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading, and which have a readily available fair value, are classified as debt securities available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on debt securities available-for-sale, which are included in net gain (loss) on sale of debt securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Declines in the value of debt securities that are considered other-than- temporary reduce the value of the asset, and the estimated loss is recorded in non-interest income. For debt securities, the Corporation assesses whether (a) it has the intent to sell the debt security, or (b) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, an other-than-temporary impairment on the security is recognized. In instances in which a determination is made that a credit loss (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) exists but the entity does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (i.e., the amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), the impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss, and (b) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount of the total impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive loss. The other-than- temporary impairment analyses for debt securities are performed on a quarterly basis.
• Equity securities that have readily available fair values are reported at fair value. Equity securities that do not have readily available fair values are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Stock that is owned by the Corporation to comply with
72
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

regulatory requirements, such as Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, is included in this category, and their realizable value equals their cost. Unrealized gains and losses of equity securities are included in net gain (loss), including impairment on equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The amortization of premiums is deducted and the accretion of discounts is added to net interest income based on the interest method over the outstanding period of the related securities. Purchases and sales of securities are recognized on a trade date basis.
Derivative financial instruments
All derivatives are recognized on the Statements of Financial Condition at fair value. The Corporation’s policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement nor to offset the fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments.
For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument, to the extent that it is effective, are recorded net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified to net income (loss) in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts earnings. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in current earnings. For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period earnings.
Prior to entering a hedge transaction, the Corporation formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivative instruments to specific assets and liabilities on the Statements of Financial Condition or to specific forecasted transactions or firm commitments along with a formal assessment, at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, a derivative expires, is sold, terminated, when it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur or when it is determined that it is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative continues to be carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.
For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the
determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.
The fair value of derivative instruments considers the risk of non-performance by the counterparty or the Corporation, as applicable.
The Corporation obtains or pledges collateral in connection with its derivative activities when applicable under the agreement.
Loans
Loans are classified as loans held-in-portfolio when management has the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. The foreseeable future is a management judgment which is determined based upon the type of loan, business strategies, current market conditions, balance sheet management and liquidity needs. Management’s view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in these conditions. When a decision is made to sell or securitize a loan that was not originated or initially acquired with the intent to sell or securitize, the loan is reclassified from held-in-portfolio into held-for-sale. Due to changing market conditions or other strategic initiatives, management’s intent with respect to the disposition of the loan may change, and accordingly, loans previously classified as held-for-sale may be reclassified into held-in-portfolio. Loans transferred between loans held-for-sale and held-in-portfolio classifications are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value at the date of transfer.
Purchased loans are accounted at fair value upon acquisition. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded at the acquisition date.
Loans held-for-sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value, cost being determined based on the outstanding loan balance less unearned income, and fair value determined, generally in the aggregate. Fair value is measured based on current market prices for similar loans, outstanding investor commitments, prices of recent sales or discounted cash flow analyses which utilize inputs and assumptions which are believed to be consistent with market participants’ views. The cost basis also includes consideration of deferred origination fees and costs, which are recognized in earnings at the time of sale. Upon reclassification to held-for-sale, credit related fair value adjustments are recorded as a reduction in the allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”). To the extent that the loan’s reduction in value has not already been provided for in the allowance for loan losses, an additional loan loss provision is recorded. Subsequent to reclassification to held-for-sale, the amount, by which cost exceeds fair value, if any, is accounted for as a valuation allowance with changes therein included in the determination of net income (loss) for the period in which the change occurs.
Loans held-in-portfolio are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs,
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 73

unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Fees collected and costs incurred in the origination of new loans are deferred and amortized using the interest method or a method which approximates the interest method over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest yield.
The past due status of a loan is determined in accordance with its contractual repayment terms. Furthermore, loans are reported as past due when either interest or principal remains unpaid for 30 days or more in accordance with its contractual repayment terms.
Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income and the loan is accounted for either on a cash- basis method or on the cost-recovery method. Loans designated as non-accruing are returned to accrual status when the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest.
Recognition of interest income on commercial and construction loans is discontinued when the loans are 90 days or more in arrears on payments of principal or interest or when other factors indicate that the collection of principal and interest is doubtful. The impaired portion of secured loan past due as to principal and interest is charged-off not later than 365 days past due. However, in the case of a collateral dependent loan individually evaluated for impairment, the excess of the recorded investment over the fair value of the collateral (portion deemed uncollectible) is generally promptly charged-off, but in any event, not later than the quarter following the quarter in which such excess was first recognized. Commercial unsecured loans are charged-off no later than 180 days past due. Recognition of interest income on mortgage loans is generally discontinued when loans are 90 days or more in arrears on payments of principal or interest. The impaired portion of a mortgage loan is charged-off when the loan is 180 days past due. The Corporation discontinues the recognition of interest on residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) when 15-months delinquent as to principal or interest. The principal repayment on these loans is insured. Recognition of interest income on closed-end consumer loans and home equity lines of credit is discontinued when the loans are 90 days or more in arrears on payments of principal or interest. Income is generally recognized on open-end consumer loans, except for home equity lines of credit, until the loans are charged-off. Recognition of interest income for lease financing is ceased when loans are 90 days or more in arrears. Closed-end consumer loans and leases are charged-off when they are 120 days in arrears. Open-end (revolving credit) consumer loans are charged-off when 180 days in arrears. Commercial and consumer overdrafts are generally charged-off no later than 60 days past their due date.
A loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) is typically in non-accrual status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan continues in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at least six months of sustained performance after the modification (or one year for loans providing for quarterly or semi-annual payments)) and management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in the foreseeable future.
Lease financing
The Corporation leases passenger and commercial vehicles and equipment to individual and corporate customers. The finance method of accounting is used to recognize revenue on lease contracts that meet the criteria specified in the guidance for leases in ASC Topic 840. Aggregate rentals due over the term of the leases less unearned income are included in finance lease contracts receivable. Unearned income is amortized using a method which results in approximate level rates of return on the principal amounts outstanding. Finance lease origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized over the average life of the lease as an adjustment to the interest yield.
Revenue for other leases is recognized as it becomes due under the terms of the agreement.
Loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality accounted for under ASC 310-30
Loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 represent loans showing evidence of credit deterioration and that it is probable, at the date of acquisition, that the Corporation would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. Generally, acquired loans that meet the definition for nonaccrual status fall within the Corporation’s definition of impaired loans under ASC Subtopic 310-30. Also, for acquisitions that include a significant amount of impaired loans, an election can be made for non-impaired loans included in such transactions to apply the accretable yield method (expected cash flow model of ASC Subtopic 310-30), by analogy, to those loans. Those loans are disclosed as a loan that was acquired with credit deterioration and impairment.
Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, impaired loans are aggregated into pools based on loans that have common risk characteristics. Each loan pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Characteristics considered in pooling loans include loan type, interest rate type, accruing status, amortization type, rate index and source type. Once the pools are defined, the Corporation maintains the integrity of the pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single asset.
Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value in the loans, or the “accretable yield,” is recognized as
74 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

interest income using the effective yield method over the estimated life of the loan if the timing and amount of the future cash flows of the pool is reasonably estimable. Therefore, these loans are not considered non-performing. The non-accretable difference represents the difference between contractually required principal and interest and the cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized as a reduction of any allowance for loan losses established after the acquisition and then as an increase in the accretable yield for the loans prospectively. Decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses. Loans charged-off against the non-accretable difference established in purchase accounting are not reported as charge-offs. Charge-offs on loans accounted under ASC Subtopic 310-30 are recorded only to the extent that losses exceed the non-accretable difference established with purchase accounting.
Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality under ASC 310-30.
Allowance for loan losses
The Corporation follows a systematic methodology to establish and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio. This methodology includes the consideration of factors such as current economic conditions, portfolio risk characteristics, prior loss experience and results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans. The provision for loan losses charged to current operations is based on this methodology. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
The Corporation’s assessment of the allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with the guidance of loss contingencies in ASC Subtopic 450-20 and loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35. Also, the Corporation determines the allowance for loan losses on purchased impaired loans and purchased loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30, by evaluating decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date.
For a detailed description of the principal factors used to determine the general reserves of the allowance for loan losses and for the principal enhancements Management made to its methodology, refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
According to the loan impairment accounting guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35, a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the principal and/or interest are not going to be collected according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Current information and events include “environmental” factors, e.g. existing industry, geographical, economic and political factors.
Probable means the future event or events which will confirm the loss or impairment of the loan is likely to occur.
The Corporation defines commercial and construction impaired loans as borrowers with total debt greater than or equal to $1 million with 90 days or more past due, as well as all loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDRs”). In addition, larger commercial and construction loans ($1 million and over) that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review and thus evaluated for impairment. Commercial and construction loans that originally met the Corporation’s threshold for impairment identification in a prior period, but due to charge-offs or payments are currently below the $1 million threshold and are still 90 days past due, except for TDRs, are accounted for under the Corporation’s general reserve methodology. Although the accounting codification guidance for specific impairment of a loan excludes large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment (e.g. mortgage and consumer loans), it specifically requires that loan modifications considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) be analyzed under its provisions. An allowance for loan impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of an impaired loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective rate, the observable market price of the loan, if available, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The fair value of the collateral is generally based on appraisals. Appraisals may be adjusted due to their age, and the type, location, and condition of the property or area or general market conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date of the appraisal and the impairment measurement date. The Corporation requests updated appraisal reports from pre-approved appraisers for loans that are considered impaired following the Corporation’s reappraisals policy. This policy requires updated appraisals for loans secured by real estate (including construction loans) either annually or every two years depending on the total exposure of the borrower. As a general procedure, the Corporation internally reviews appraisals as part of the underwriting and approval process and also for credits considered impaired.
Troubled debt restructurings
A restructuring constitutes a TDR when the Corporation separately concludes that both of the following conditions exist: 1) the restructuring constitute a concession and 2) the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. The concessions stem from an agreement between the Corporation and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. A concession has been granted when, as a result of the restructuring, the Corporation does not expect to
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 75

collect all amounts due, including interest accrued at the original contract rate. If the payment of principal is dependent on the value of collateral, the current value of the collateral is taken into consideration in determining the amount of principal to be collected; therefore, all factors that changed are considered to determine if a concession was granted, including the change in the fair value of the underlying collateral that may be used to repay the loan. Classification of loan modifications as TDRs involves a degree of judgment. Indicators that the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties which are considered include: (i) the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification; (ii) the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii) there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv) the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; (v) based on estimates and projections that only encompass the borrower’s current business capabilities, it is forecasted that the entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and (vi) absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. The identification of TDRs is critical in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Loans classified as TDRs may be excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms exists for a reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance) and the loan yields a market rate.
A loan may be restructured in a troubled debt restructuring into two (or more) loan agreements, for example, Note A and Note B. Note A represents the portion of the original loan principal amount that is expected to be fully collected along with contractual interest. Note B represents the portion of the original loan that may be considered uncollectible and charged-off, but the obligation is not forgiven to the borrower. Note A may be returned to accrual status provided all of the conditions for a TDR to be returned to accrual status are met. The modified loans are considered TDRs and thus, are evaluated under the framework of ASC Section 310-10-35 as long as the loans are not part of a pool of loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30.
Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional qualitative information on TDRs and the Corporation’s determination of the allowance for loan losses.
Reserve for unfunded commitments
The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Transfers and servicing of financial assets
The transfer of an entire financial asset, a group of entire financial assets, or a participating interest in an entire financial asset in which the Corporation surrenders control over the assets is accounted for as a sale if all of the following conditions set forth in ASC Topic 860 are met: (1) the assets must be isolated from creditors of the transferor, (2) the transferee must obtain the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the transferor cannot maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. When the Corporation transfers financial assets and the transfer fails any one of these criteria, the Corporation is prevented from derecognizing the transferred financial assets and the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing. For federal and Puerto Rico income tax purposes, the Corporation treats the transfers of loans which do not qualify as “true sales” under the applicable accounting guidance, as sales, recognizing a deferred tax asset or liability on the transaction.
For transfers of financial assets that satisfy the conditions to be accounted for as sales, the Corporation derecognizes all assets sold; recognizes all assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale, including servicing assets and servicing liabilities, if applicable; initially measures at fair value assets obtained and liabilities incurred in a sale; and recognizes in earnings any gain or loss on the sale.
The guidance on transfer of financial assets requires a true sale analysis of the treatment of the transfer under state law as if the Corporation was a debtor under the bankruptcy code. A true sale legal analysis includes several legally relevant factors, such as the nature and level of recourse to the transferor, and the nature of retained interests in the loans sold. The analytical conclusion as to a true sale is never absolute and unconditional, but contains qualifications based on the inherent equitable powers of a bankruptcy court, as well as the unsettled state of the common law. Once the legal isolation test has been met, other factors concerning the nature and extent of the transferor’s control over the transferred assets are taken into account in order to determine whether derecognition of assets is warranted.
The Corporation sells mortgage loans to the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) in the normal course of business and retains the servicing rights. The GNMA programs under which the loans are sold allow the Corporation to repurchase individual delinquent loans that meet certain
76 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

criteria. At the Corporation’s option, and without GNMA’s prior authorization, the Corporation may repurchase the delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100% of the remaining principal balance of the loan. Once the Corporation has the unconditional ability to repurchase the delinquent loan, the Corporation is deemed to have regained effective control over the loan and recognizes the loan on its balance sheet as well as an offsetting liability, regardless of the Corporation’s intent to repurchase the loan.
Servicing assets
The Corporation periodically sells or securitizes loans while retaining the obligation to perform the servicing of such loans. In addition, the Corporation may purchase or assume the right to service loans originated by others. Whenever the Corporation undertakes an obligation to service a loan, management assesses whether a servicing asset or liability should be recognized. A servicing asset is recognized whenever the compensation for servicing is expected to more than adequately compensate the servicer for performing the servicing. Likewise, a servicing liability would be recognized in the event that servicing fees to be received are not expected to adequately compensate the Corporation for its expected cost. Mortgage servicing assets recorded at fair value are separately presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
All separately recognized servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value. For subsequent measurement of servicing rights, the Corporation has elected the fair value method for mortgage loans servicing rights (“MSRs”). Under the fair value measurement method, MSRs are recorded at fair value each reporting period, and changes in fair value are reported in mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Contractual servicing fees including ancillary income and late fees, as well as fair value adjustments, and impairment losses, if any, are reported in mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Loan servicing fees, which are based on a percentage of the principal balances of the loans serviced, are credited to income as loan payments are collected.
The fair value of servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market conditions.
Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each type of asset. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful
lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Costs of maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Costs of renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings as realized or incurred, respectively.
The Corporation capitalizes interest cost incurred in the construction of significant real estate projects, which consist primarily of facilities for its own use or intended for lease. The amount of interest cost capitalized is to be an allocation of the interest cost incurred during the period required to substantially complete the asset. The interest rate for capitalization purposes is to be based on a weighted average rate on the Corporation’s outstanding borrowings, unless there is a specific new borrowing associated with the asset. Interest cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was not significant.
The Corporation has operating lease arrangements primarily associated with the rental of premises to support its branch network or for general office space. Certain of these arrangements are non-cancellable and provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Rent expense on non-cancellable operating leases with scheduled rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Corporation evaluates for impairment its long-lived assets to be held and used, and long-lived assets to be disposed of, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Other real estate
Other real estate, received in satisfaction of a loan, is recorded at fair value less estimated costs of disposal. The difference between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value less cost to sell is recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, any losses in the carrying value arising from periodic re-evaluations of the properties, and any gains or losses on the sale of these properties are credited or charged to expense in the period incurred and are included as OREO expenses. The cost of maintaining and operating such properties is expensed as incurred.
Updated appraisals are obtained to adjust the value of the other real estate assets. The frequency depends on the loan type and total credit exposure. The appraisal for a commercial or construction other real estate property with a book value equal to or greater than $1 million is updated annually and if lower than $1 million it is updated every two years. For residential mortgage properties, the Corporation requests appraisals annually.
Appraisals may be adjusted due to age, collateral inspections, property profiles, or general market conditions.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 77

The adjustments applied are based upon internal information such as other appraisals for the type of properties and/or loss severity information that can provide historical trends in the real estate market, and may change from time to time based on market conditions.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill is recognized when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment using a two-step process at each reporting unit level. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If needed, the second step consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In determining the fair value of a reporting unit, the Corporation generally uses a combination of methods, which include market price multiples of comparable companies and the discounted cash flow analysis. Goodwill impairment losses are recorded as part of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are tested for impairment using a one-step process which compares the fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. In determining that an intangible asset has an indefinite life, the Corporation considers expected cash inflows and legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic and other factors, which could limit the intangible asset’s useful life.
Other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life, mainly core deposits, are amortized using various methods over the periods benefited, which range from 5 to 10 years. These intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments on intangible assets with a finite useful life are evaluated under the guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
Assets sold / purchased under agreements to repurchase / resell
Repurchase and resell agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the assets will be subsequently reacquired or resold as specified in the respective agreements.
It is the Corporation’s policy to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. However, the counterparties to such agreements maintain effective control
over such securities, and accordingly those securities are not reflected in the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest.
It is the Corporation’s policy to maintain effective control over assets sold under agreements to repurchase; accordingly, such securities continue to be carried on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
The Corporation may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged, when appropriate.
Software
Capitalized software is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Capitalized software includes purchased software and capitalizable application development costs associated with internally-developed software. Amortization, computed on a straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized software is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.
Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others
The Corporation, as a guarantor, recognizes at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosures on guarantees.
Treasury stock
Treasury stock is recorded at cost and is carried as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. At the date of retirement or subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock. At retirement, the excess of the cost of the treasury stock over its par value is recorded entirely to surplus. At reissuance, the difference between the consideration received upon issuance and the specific cost is charged or credited to surplus.
Revenues from contract with customers
Refer to Note 33 for a detailed description of the Corporation’s policies on the recognition and presentation of revenues from contract with customers.
Foreign exchange
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars using prevailing rates of exchange at the end of the period. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using weighted average rates for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment from
78 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

operations for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, except for highly inflationary environments in which the effects are included in other operating expenses.
The Corporation holds interests in Centro Financiero BHD León, S.A. (“BHD León”) in the Dominican Republic. The business of BHD León is mainly conducted in their country’s foreign currency. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment from these operations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Refer to the disclosure of accumulated other comprehensive loss included in Note 23.
Income taxes
The Corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Corporation’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. The computation is based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The guidance for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically by the Corporation based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, the future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. In making such assessments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.
The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Corporation’s financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The Corporation’s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of those future events.
Positions taken in the Corporation’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and
subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest on income tax uncertainties is classified within income tax expense in the Statement of Operations; while the penalties, if any, are accounted for as other operating expenses.
The Corporation accounts for the taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
Income tax expense or benefit for the year is allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, and other comprehensive income, as applicable. The amount allocated to continuing operations is the tax effect of the pre-tax income or loss from continuing operations that occurred during the year, plus or minus income tax effects of (a) changes in circumstances that cause a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future years, (b) changes in tax laws or rates, (c) changes in tax status, and (d) tax-deductible dividends paid to shareholders, subject to certain exceptions.
Employees’ retirement and other postretirement benefit plans
Pension costs are computed on the basis of accepted actuarial methods and are charged to current operations. Net pension costs are based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plan, which include costs for services rendered during the period, interest costs and return on plan assets, as well as deferral and amortization of certain items such as actuarial gains or losses.
The funding policy is to contribute to the plan, as necessary, to provide for services to date and for those expected to be earned in the future. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the plan, a contribution may not be made in a particular year.
The cost of postretirement benefits, which is determined based on actuarial assumptions and estimates of the costs of providing these benefits in the future, is accrued during the years that the employee renders the required service.
The guidance for compensation retirement benefits of ASC Topic 715 requires the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan, retiree health care and other postretirement benefit plans on the Statement of Financial Condition.
Stock-based compensation
The Corporation opted to use the fair value method of recording stock-based compensation as described in the guidance for employee share plans in ASC Subtopic 718-50.
Comprehensive income (loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 79

other events and circumstances, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The presentation of comprehensive income (loss) is included in separate Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Net income (loss) per common share
Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) adjusted for preferred stock dividends, including undeclared or unpaid dividends if cumulative, and charges or credits related to the extinguishment of preferred stock or induced conversions of preferred stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common share takes into consideration the weighted average common shares adjusted for the effect of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and warrants, if any, using the treasury stock method.
Statement of cash flows
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash includes cash on hand and amounts due from banks, including restricted cash.
Note 3 - New accounting pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
The FASB issued ASU 2018-13 in August 2018, which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The most significant changes include, among other things, the removal of the requirements to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. In addition, certain disclosure requirements were added, which include but are not limited to, how the weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements was calculated.
The Corporation early adopted this accounting pronouncement as of December 31, 2018 and was principally impacted by the simplified disclosures on fair value measurements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The FASB issued ASU 2018-03 in February 2018, which clarifies certain aspects of the guidance in ASU 2016-01, principally related to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.
The Corporation was not impacted by these technical corrections and improvements upon adoption of this ASU.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost
The FASB issued ASU 2017-07 in March 2017, which requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost of pension and postretirement benefit plans. The amendments also provide guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allow only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization.
As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Corporation recognized $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 (2017 - $7.5 million; 2016 - $10.1 million) as components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost in the other operating expenses caption, which would have otherwise previously been recognized as personnel cost. The presentation for prior periods has been adjusted to reflect the new classification. Effective January 1, 2018, these expenses are no longer capitalized as part of loan origination costs.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets
The FASB issued ASU 2017-05 in February 2017, which, among other things, clarifies the scope of the derecognition of nonfinancial assets, the definition of in substance financial assets, and impacts the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets by requiring full gain recognition upon the sale.
The adoption of this standard during the first quarter of 2018 did not have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business
The FASB issued ASU 2017-01 in January 2017, which revises the definition of a business by providing an initial screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (“set”) is not a business. Also, the amendments, among other things, specify the minimum inputs and processes required for a set to meet the definition of a business when the initial screen is not met and narrow the definition of the term output so that the term is consistent with Topic 606.
The Corporation adopted ASU 2017-01 during the first quarter of 2018. As such, the Corporation will consider this
80 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

guidance in any business combinations completed after the effective date. Refer to Note 4, Business combination, for additional information on assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Reliable Transaction.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
The FASB issued ASU 2016-18 in November 2016, which requires entities to present the changes in total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance also requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet if restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in a different line item in the balance sheet.
As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Corporation included restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within money market investments of $9.2 million at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $9.8 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, the Corporation presented a reconciliation of the totals in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to the related captions in the Consolidated Statements of Condition in Note 38, Supplemental disclosure on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
The FASB issued ASU 2016-16 in October 2016, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory that requires deferral of the tax effects until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance requires a reporting entity to recognize the tax impact from the sale of the asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer’s jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer.
As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement during the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation recorded a positive cumulative effect adjustment of $1.3 million to retained earnings to reflect the net tax benefit resulting from intra-entity sales of assets.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments
The FASB issued ASU 2016-15 in August 2016, which addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice, which may lead to a difference in the classification of transactions between operating, financing or investing activities. Among other things,
the guidance provides an accounting policy election for classifying distributions received from equity method investees and clarifies the application of the predominance principle.
As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Corporation reclassified from investing to operating activities $0.5 million in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of electing the cumulative earnings approach for classifying distributions received from equity investees.
FASB Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
The FASB has issued a series of ASUs which, among other things, clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services, that is, the satisfaction of performance obligations, to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. A five-step process is defined to achieve this core principle. The new guidance also requires disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The Corporation adopted this accounting pronouncement during the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The Corporation elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to expense incremental costs of obtaining contracts, given the amortization periods were one year or less. There were no material changes in the presentation and timing of when revenues are recognized. ASC Topic 606 was applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. There was no impact in the evaluation of these contracts. Refer to additional disclosures on Note 33, Revenue from contracts with customers.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and FinancialLiabilities
The FASB issued ASU 2016-01 in January 2016, which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option as follows: require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values; require changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk to be presented separately in other comprehensive income for financial liabilities under the fair value option; and clarify that the need for a valuation
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 81

allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities should be evaluated in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets. In addition, the ASU also impacts the presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments.
As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement during the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation aggregated $11 million previously classified as available-for-sale and as trading to those under the other investment securities caption and reclassified under the caption of equity securities. In addition, a positive cumulative effect adjustment of $0.6 million was recognized due to the reclassification of unrealized gains of equity securities available-for-sale, net of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.
The adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, effective during the first quarter of 2018, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
The FASB issued ASU 2018-19 in November 2018 which, among other things, clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of ASC Topic 326.
The amendments in this ASU are effective on January 1, 2020.
The Corporation will consider this guidance upon adoption of ASC Topic 326.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606
The FASB issued ASU 2018-18 in November 2018 which, among other things, provides guidance on how to assess whether certain collaborative arrangement transactions should be accounted for under Topic 606.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
The Corporation does not expect to be impacted by these amendments since it does not have collaborative arrangements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities
The FASB issued ASU 2018-17 in October 2018, which requires entities to consider indirect interests held through related
parties under common control on a proportional basis rather than as the equivalent of a direct interest in its entirety when determining whether a decision-making fee is a variable interest.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. These amendments should be applied retrospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The Corporation does not expect to be materially impacted by these amendments.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes
The FASB issued ASU 2018-16 in October 2018 which permit use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to other permissible U.S. benchmark rates.
The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted concurrently with the amendments in ASU 2017-12, which are effective in the first quarter of 2019. The amendments should be adopted on a prospective basis for qualifying new or re-designated hedging relationships entered into on or after the date of adoption.
The Corporation will consider this guidance for qualifying new hedging relationships entered into on or after the effective date.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract
The FASB issued ASU 2018-15 in August 2018 which, among other things, aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software, and clarifies the term over which such capitalized implementation costs should be amortized.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
The Corporation does not expect to be materially impacted by these amendments.
82 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans
The FASB issued ASU 2018-14 in August 2018, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or postretirement plans. The most significant changes include the removal of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year and the effects of a one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. In addition, certain disclosure requirements were added which include, but are not limited to, an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented.
Upon adoption of this standard, the Corporation will be impacted principally by the simplified disclosures on defined benefit plans.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts
The FASB issued ASU 2018-12 in August 2018, which makes targeted improvements to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Corporation does not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-09, Codification Improvements
The FASB issued ASU 2018-09 in July 2018, which makes various codification improvements in the areas of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation awards, income tax accounting for business combinations, derivatives offsetting, liability or equity-classified financial instruments, among others.
The amendments in this ASU are effective immediately, except for amendments that require transition guidance, which are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018; and
amendments to guidance not yet effective which are effective on the same date as the original Updates.
The Corporation does not expect to be materially impacted by these Codification improvements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
The FASB issued ASU 2018-07 in June 2018, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees, although differences remain in the accounting for attribution and a contractual term election for valuing nonemployee equity share options.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Corporation does not expect to be impacted by these amendments since it does not enter into share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-06, Codification Improvements to Topic 942, Financial Services - Depository and Lending
The FASB issued ASU 2018-06 in May 2018, which removes outdated guidance related to the Comptroller of the Currency’s Banking Circular 202, “Accounting for Net Deferred Taxes” in ASC Topic 942.
The amendments in this ASU were effective upon issuance of the Update. The Corporation was not impacted by this Codification improvement.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The FASB issued ASU 2018-02 in February 2018, which allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These stranded tax effects result from recognizing in income the impact of changes in tax rates even when the related tax effects were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendments also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.
The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its U.S. operations. As such, the Corporation does not

anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
The FASB issued ASU 2017-12 in August 2017, which makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting and changes how companies assess effectiveness by, among other things, eliminating the requirement for entities to recognize hedge ineffectiveness each reporting period for cash flow hedges and requiring presentation of the changes in fair value of cash flow hedges in the same income statement line item(s) as the earnings effect of the hedged items when the hedged item affects earnings.
The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach as of the adoption date.
The Corporation will be impacted by the simplified application of hedge accounting. The Corporation does not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations since hedge ineffectiveness has been immaterial to the Corporation and the earnings effect of the hedges and the hedged items are already presented in the same income statement line item.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-11, Earnings per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815): Part I: Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; Part II: Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception
The FASB issued ASU 2017-11 in July 2017, which changes the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments with down round features. When determining whether these instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. For EPS purposes, the effect of the down round feature should be recognized as a dividend when triggered.
The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update may be applied using either a
modified retrospective approach or a full retrospective approach.
The Corporation does not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations since it does not have any outstanding equity-linked financial instruments with a down round feature.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities
The FASB issued ASU 2017-08 in March 2017, which amends the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium by shortening such period to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.
The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
The Corporation does not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations since the premium of purchased callable debt securities is not significant.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment
The FASB issued ASU 2017-04 in January 2017, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test under the current guidance. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
The amendments of this Update, which should be applied on a prospective basis, are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
Upon adoption of this standard, if the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value, the Corporation would be required to record an impairment charge for the difference up to the amount of the goodwill.

FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-03, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the September 22, 2016 and November 17, 2016 EITF Meetings (SEC Update)
The FASB issued ASU 2017-03 in January 2017, which incorporates into the Accounting Standards Codification recent SEC guidance about certain investments in qualified affordable housing and disclosing under SEC SAB Topic 11.M the effect on financial statements of adopting the revenue, leases and credit losses standards.
The Corporation has considered the guidance in this Update related to the disclosure on the effect on financial statements of adopting the leases and credit losses standards in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
The FASB issued ASU 2016-13 in June 2016, which replaces the incurred loss model with a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. The CECL model applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures. Under current U.S. GAAP, an entity reflects credit losses on financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis only when losses are probable and have been incurred, generally considering only past events and current conditions in making these determinations. ASU 2016-13 prospectively replaces this approach with a forward-looking methodology that reflects the expected credit losses over the lives of financial assets, starting when such assets are first acquired. Under the revised methodology, credit losses will be measured based on past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also revises the approach to recognizing credit losses for available-for-sale securities by replacing the direct write-down approach with the allowance approach and limiting the allowance to the amount at which the security’s fair value is less than the amortized cost. In addition, ASU 2016-13 provides that the initial allowance for credit losses on purchased credit impaired financial assets will be recorded as an increase to the purchase price, with subsequent changes to the allowance recorded as a credit loss expense.
ASU 2016-13 also expands disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for credit losses.
The amendments of this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2019.
The Corporation has continued its evaluation and implementation efforts for ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, and has established a cross- discipline governance structure. A CECL Working Group, with members from different areas within the organization, has been created and assigned the responsibility of assessing the impact of the standard, evaluating interpretative issues, evaluating the current credit loss models against the new guidance to determine any changes necessary and other related implementation activities. The Working Group provides periodic updates to the CECL Steering Committee, which has oversight responsibilities for the implementation efforts.
The Corporation plans to adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective approach. Although early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Corporation does not expect to make that election. The Corporation expects an increase in its allowance for loan and lease losses due to the consideration of lifetime credit losses as part of the calculation.
FASB Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”), Leases (Topic842)
The FASB has issued a series of ASUs which, among other things, supersede ASC Topic 840 and set out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessors and lessees. The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
In addition, the new leases standard requires lessors, among other things, to present lessor costs paid by the lessee to the lessor on a gross basis. The Corporation does not expect to be materially impacted by these amendments.
Upon adoption of this accounting pronouncement on January 1, 2019, the Corporation will elect the practical expedients to not reassess at the date of adoption whether any existing contracts were or contained leases, their lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Corporation will also elect the optional transition method that allows application of the transition provisions of the new leases standard at the adoption date, instead of at the earliest comparative period
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 85

presented. Therefore, comparative periods will continue to be presented in accordance with ASC Topic 840.
As of January 1, 2019, the Corporation will recognize ROU assets of $139 million, net of deferred rent liability of $15 million and lease liabilities of $154 million on its operating leases. In addition, the Corporation recorded a positive cumulative effect adjustment of $4.8 million to retained earnings as a result of the reclassification of previously deferred gains on sale and operating lease back transactions.
Note 4 - Business combination
On August 1, 2018, Popular Auto, LLC (“Popular Auto”), BPPR’s auto finance subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to Wells Fargo & Company’s (“Wells Fargo”) auto finance business in Puerto Rico (“Reliable”). Popular Auto acquired approximately $1.6 billion in retail auto loans and $341 million in primarily auto-related commercial loans. Reliable will
continue operating as a Division of Popular Auto in parallel with Popular Auto’s existing operations for a period after closing to provide continuity of service to Reliable customers while allowing Popular to assess best practices before completing the integration of the two operations.
Wells Fargo retained approximately $398 million in retail auto loans as part of the Transaction and subsequently sold the same to a third party. Popular Auto has entered into a separate servicing agreement with respect to such loans.
Popular entered into the Transaction as part of its growth strategy to increase its market share in the auto finance business in Puerto Rico.
The following table presents the fair values of the consideration and major classes of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Corporation as of August 1, 2018, net of cumulative measurement period adjustments as of period end.

loans from the preliminary estimated amounts by $12.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, was mainly attributed to decreases in credit loss expectations. The related cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the fair value discounts for the retail and commercial portfolios offset each other, resulting in an immaterial impact to the Corporation’s results.
Following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets acquired on the Reliable Transaction:

Fair values for retail auto loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology. Aggregation into pools considered

Goodwill on acquisition
[1] The fair value discount is comprised of $106 million related to the retail auto loans portfolio and $4 million related to the commercial loans portfolio.
    The fair values initially assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as new information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. The Corporation continues to analyze its estimates of fair value on loans acquired. As the Corporation finalizes its analyses, there may continue to be adjustments to the recorded carrying values, and thus the recognized goodwill may increase or decrease.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, measurement period adjustments, amounting to $16.5 million, were made to the estimated fair values of the loans acquired as part of the Transaction to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The increase in the fair value of retail auto loans and commercial

characteristics such as payment terms, remaining terms, and credit quality. Principal and interest projections considered prepayment rates and credit loss expectations. The discount rates were developed based on the relative risk of the cash flows as of the valuation date, taking into account the expected life of the loans. Retail auto loans were accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20. As of August 1, 2018, contractual cash flows amounted to $1.8 billion, from which $105 million are not expected to be collected.
Commercial Loans
Fair values for commercial loans were based on a probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”) methodology. The PD was determined based on characteristics such as payment terms, remaining terms, and credit quality. Commercial loans were accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20. As of August 1, 2018, contractual cash flows amounted to $348 million, from which $3 million are not expected to be collected.
Goodwill
The amount of goodwill is the residual difference between the consideration transferred to Wells Fargo and the fair value of the assets acquired, net of the liabilities assumed. The goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.
Trademark
The fair value of the Reliable trademark was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method. The Reliable trademark is subject to amortization, since Popular intends to use the trademark for a limited period of time.
The operating results of the Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the operating results produced by
the acquired assets and liabilities assumed for the period of August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. This includes approximately $84.5 million in gross revenues, including $28.1 million in accretion of the fair value discount, and approximately $20.3 million in operating expenses, including $3.8 million of transaction-related expenses. The Corporation believes that given the amount of assets and liabilities assumed and the size of the operations acquired in relation to Popular’s operations, the historical results of Reliable are not significant to Popular’s results, and thus no pro forma information is presented.
Note 5 - Restrictions on cash and due from banks and certainsecurities
The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are required by federal and state regulatory agencies to maintain average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Fed”) or other banks. Those required average reserve balances amounted to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $1.4 billion). Cash and due from banks, as well as other highly liquid securities, are used to cover the required average reserve balances.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation held $62 million in restricted assets in the form of funds deposited in money market accounts, debt securities available for sale and equity securities (December 31, 2017 - $41 million). The restricted assets held in debt securities available for sale and equity securities consist primarily of assets held for the Corporation’s non-qualified retirement plans and fund deposits guaranteeing possible liens or encumbrances over the title of insured properties.

 The weighted average yield on debt securities available-for-sale is based on amortized cost; therefore, it does not give effect to changes in fair value.
Securities not due on a single contractual maturity date, such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, are classified in the period of final contractual maturity. The expected maturities of collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities and certain other securities may differ from their contractual maturities because they may be subject to prepayments or may be called by the issuer.

   As of December 31, 2018, the portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities reflects gross unrealized losses of approximately $209 million, driven mainly by mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Management evaluates debt securities for other-than- temporary (“OTTI”) declines in fair value on a quarterly basis. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than- temporary, the value of a debt security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized for anticipated credit losses. The OTTI analysis requires management to consider various factors, which include, but are not limited to: (1) the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (2) the financial
condition of
attributes, (4) the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments, (5) any rating changes by a rating agency, (6) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry, or a geographic area, and (7) management’s intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that the Corporation would be required to sell the debt security before a forecasted recovery occurs.
At December 31, 2018, management performed its quarterly analysis of all debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Based on the analysis performed, management concluded that no individual debt security was other-than-temporarily

impaired as of such date. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation did not have the intent to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position and it was not more likely than not that the Corporation would have to sell the debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis.

As indicated in Note 6 to these Consolidated Financial Statements, management evaluates debt securities for OTTI declines in fair value on a quarterly basis.
The “Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and political subdivisions” classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2018 are primarily associated with securities issued by municipalities of Puerto Rico and are generally not rated by a credit rating agency. This includes $45 million of general and special obligation bonds issued by three municipalities of Puerto Rico, which are payable primarily from certain property taxes imposed by the issuing municipality. In the case of general obligations, they also benefit from a pledge of the full faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the issuing municipality and issuing municipalities are required by law to levy property taxes in an amount sufficient for the payment of debt service on such general obligation bonds.
The portfolio also includes $45 million in securities for which the underlying source of payment is not the central government, but in which a government instrumentality provides a guarantee in the event of default. The Corporation performs periodic credit quality reviews on these issuers. Based on the quarterly analysis performed, management concluded that no individual debt security held-to-maturity was other- than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2018. Further deterioration of the Puerto Rico economy or of the fiscal crisis of the Government of Puerto Rico (including if any of the issuing municipalities become subject to a debt restructuring proceeding under PROMESA) could further affect the value of these securities, resulting in losses to the Corporation. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell debt securities held-to-maturity and it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not have to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis.
Refer to Note 25 for additional information on the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico Government.
Note 8 - Loans
For a summary of the accounting policies related to loans, interest recognition and allowance for loan losses refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K.
The Corporation has presented the loans covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC separately as “covered loans” since the risk of loss was significantly different than those not covered under the loss-sharing agreements, due to the loss protection provided by the FDIC. As discussed in Note 10, on May 22, 2018, the Corporation entered into a Termination Agreement with the FDIC to terminate all loss-share arrangements in connection with the Westernbank FDIC- assisted transaction. As a result of the Termination Agreement, assets that were covered by the loss share agreement, including covered loans in the amount of approximately $514.6 million as of March 31, 2018, were reclassified as non-covered. The
Corporation now recognizes entirely all future credit losses, expenses, gains, and recoveries related to the formerly covered assets with no offset due to or from the FDIC.
As previously disclosed in Note 4, as a result of the Reliable Transaction completed on August 1, 2018, Popular Auto, LLC, acquired approximately $1.6 billion in retail auto loans and $341 million in primarily auto-related commercial loans. These loans are included in the information presented in this note.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation recorded purchases (including repurchases) of mortgage loans amounting to $624 million and consumer loans of $205 million, compared to purchases (including repurchases) of mortgage loans of $460 million, consumer loans of $311 million, commercial loans of $2 million and leases of $2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Corporation performed whole-loan sales involving approximately $59 million of residential mortgage loans and $30 million of commercial loans during the year ended December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $64 million of residential mortgage loans). Also, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation securitized approximately $413 million of mortgage loans into Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) mortgage-backed securities and $94 million of mortgage loans into Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) mortgage-backed securities, compared to $376 million and $86 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The following table presents the composition of loans held-in-portfolio (“HIP”), net of unearned income, by past due status, and by loan class including those that are in non-performing status or that are accruing interest but are past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 96 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

At December 31, 2018, mortgage loans held-in-portfolio include $1.4 billion of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) of which $598 million are 90 days or more past due, including $134 million of loans rebooked under the GNMA buyback option, discussed below (December 31, 2017 - $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $840 million, respectively). Within this portfolio, loans in a delinquency status of 90 days or more are reported as accruing loans as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. These balances include $283 million of residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico that are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $178 million). Additionally, the Corporation has approximately $69 million in reverse mortgage loans in Puerto Rico which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $58 million).
Loans with a delinquency status of 90 days past due as of December 31, 2018 include $134 million in loans previously pooled into GNMA securities (December 31, 2017 - $840 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected on the financial statements of the Bank with an offsetting liability.

The following provides information of loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration as of the acquisition date, accounted for under the guidance of ASC 310-30.
The outstanding principal balance of acquired loans accounted pursuant to ASC Subtopic 310-30, amounted to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $2.5 billion). The carrying amount of these loans consisted of loans
determined to be impaired at the time of acquisition, which are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 (“credit impaired loans”), and loans that were considered to be performing at the acquisition date, accounted for by analogy to ASC Subtopic 310-30 (“non-credit impaired loans”).
The following table provides the carrying amount of acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 by portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 Note 9 - Allowance for loan losses
The Corporation follows a systematic methodology to establish and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio. This methodology includes the consideration of factors such as current economic conditions, portfolio risk characteristics, prior loss experience and results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans. The provision for loan losses charged to
current operations is based on this methodology. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL.
The Corporation’s assessment of the ALLL is determined in accordance with the guidance of loss contingencies in ASC Subtopic 450-20 and loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35. Also, the Corporation determines the ALLL on purchased impaired loans and purchased loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30, by evaluating decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date.
98 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The accounting guidance provides for the recognition of a loss allowance for groups of homogeneous loans. The determination of the general ALLL includes the following principal factors:
• Base net loss rates, which are based on the moving average of annualized net loss rates computed over a 5-year historical loss period for the commercial and construction loan portfolios, and an 18-month period for the consumer and mortgage loan portfolios. The base net loss rates are applied by loan type and by legal entity.
• Recent loss trend adjustment, which replaces the base loss rate with a 12-month average loss rate, when these trends are higher than the respective base loss rates. The objective of this adjustment is to allow for a more recent loss trend to be captured and reflected in the ALLL estimation process.
For the period ended December 31, 2018, 26% (December 31, 2017 – 69%) of the ALLL for the BPPR segment loan portfolios utilized the recent loss trend adjustment instead of the base loss. The recent loss trends were impacted by charge-off activity related to the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The effect of replacing the base loss with the recent loss trend adjustment was mainly concentrated in the commercial, mortgage and overall consumer portfolios for 2018 and in the leasing, credit cards, personal, auto and mortgage loan portfolios for 2017.
For the period ended December 31, 2018, 28% (December 31, 2017 – 3 %) of the Popular U.S. segment loan portfolios utilized the recent loss trend adjustment instead of the base loss. The effect of replacing the base loss with the recent loss trend adjustment was concentrated in the consumer portfolio for 2018 and 2017.
• Environmental factors, which include credit and macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rate,
economic activity index and delinquency rates, adopted to account for current market conditions that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical losses. The Corporation reflects the effect of these environmental factors on each loan group as an adjustment that, as appropriate, increases the historical loss rate applied to each group. Environmental factors provide updated perspective on credit and economic conditions. Regression analysis is used to select these indicators and quantify the effect on the general ALLL. The Corporation’s methodology also includes qualitative judgmental reserves based on stressed credit quality assumptions to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolios not embedded in the historical loss rates.
During the third quarter of 2018, management completed the annual review of the components of the ALLL models. As part of this review, management updated core metrics related to the estimation process for evaluating the adequacy of the general ALLL. These updates to the ALLL models, which are described in the paragraph below, were implemented as of September 30, 2018 and resulted in a net decrease to the ALLL of $6.1 million.
Management made the following revisions to the ALLL models during the third quarter of 2018:
• Annual review and recalibration of the environmental factors adjustments. The environmental factors adjustments are developed by performing regression analyses on selected credit and economic indicators for each applicable loan segment. During the third quarter of 2018, the environmental factor models used to account for changes in current credit and macroeconomic conditions were reviewed and recalibrated based on the latest applicable trends.
The effect of the recalibration to the environmental factors adjustments resulted in a decrease to the ALLL of $5.9 million and $0.2 million at the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments, respectively.
The following tables present the changes in the allowance for loan losses, loan ending balances and whether such loans and the allowance pertain to loans individually or collectively evaluated for impairment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

  During the year ended December 31, 2018, six loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $82.1 million were restructured into multiple notes (“Note A / B split”). The Corporation recorded $29.6 million charge -offs as part of those loan restructurings. The post-modification outstanding recorded investment in the tables above is presented net of these charge-offs. The restructuring of those loans was made after analyzing the borrowers’ capacity to repay the debt, collateral and ability to perform under the modified terms. The recorded investment on those commercial TDRs amounted to approximately $52.5 million at December 31, 2018 with a related allowance for loan losses amounting to approximately $105 thousand.
The following tables present, by class, TDRs that were subject to payment default and that had been modified as a TDR during the twelve months preceding the default date. Payment default is defined as a restructured loan becoming 90 days past due after being modified, foreclosed or charged-off, whichever occurs first. The recorded investment as of period end is inclusive of all partial paydowns and charge-offs since the modification date. Loans modified as a TDR that were fully paid down, charged-off or foreclosed upon by period end are not reported.

Commercial, consumer and mortgage loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default. If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Corporation evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. The allowance for loan losses may be increased or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan.
Credit Quality
The Corporation has defined a risk rating system to assign a rating to all credit exposures, particularly for the commercial and construction loan portfolios. Risk ratings in the aggregate provide the Corporation’s management the asset quality profile for the loan portfolio. The risk rating system provides for the assignment of ratings at the obligor level based on the financial condition of the borrower. The Corporation’s consumer and mortgage loans are not subject to the risk rating system. Consumer and mortgage loans are classified substandard or loss based on their delinquency status. All other consumer and mortgage loans that are not classified as substandard or loss would be considered “unrated”.
The Corporation’s obligor risk rating scales range from rating 1 (Excellent) to rating 14 (Loss). The obligor risk rating reflects the risk of payment default of a borrower in the ordinary course of business.
Pass Credit Classifications:
Pass (Scales 1 through 8) - Loans classified as pass have a well defined primary source of repayment, with no apparent risk, strong financial position, minimal operating risk, profitability, liquidity and strong capitalization.
Watch (Scale 9) - Loans classified as watch have acceptable business credit, but borrower’s operations, cash flow or financial condition evidence more than average risk, requires above average levels of supervision and attention from Loan Officers.
Special Mention (Scale 10) - Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Corporation’s credit position at some future date.
Adversely Classified Classifications:
Substandard (Scales 11 and 12) - Loans classified as substandard are deemed to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as such have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful (Scale 13) - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make the collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loss (Scale 14) - Uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.
Risk ratings scales 10 through 14 conform to regulatory ratings. The assignment of the obligor risk rating is based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debts such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.

    110 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The Corporation periodically reviews its loans classification to evaluate if they are properly classified, and to determine impairment, if any. The frequency of these reviews will depend on the amount of the aggregate outstanding debt, and the risk rating classification of the obligor. In addition, during the renewal and annual review process of applicable credit facilities, the Corporation evaluates the corresponding loan grades.
The Corporation has a Commercial Loan Review department within the Corporate Risk Reviews Division that reports directly to the Corporation’s Risk Management Committee and administratively to the Chief Risk Officer, which performs annual comprehensive credit process reviews of all lending groups in BPPR. This group evaluates the credit risk profile of each originating unit along with each unit’s credit
administration effectiveness, including the assessment of the risk rating representative of the current credit quality of the loans, and the evaluation of collateral documentation. The monitoring performed by this group contributes to assess compliance with credit policies and underwriting standards, determine the current level of credit risk, evaluate the effectiveness of the credit management process and identify control deficiencies that may arise in the credit-granting process. Based on its findings, Commercial Loan Review recommends corrective actions, if necessary, that help in maintaining a sound credit process. The Loan Review Group reports the results of the credit process reviews to the Risk Management Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

Note 10 – FDIC loss-share asset and true-up payment obligation
In connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, BPPR entered into loss-share arrangements with the FDIC with respect to the covered loans and other real estate owned. Pursuant to the terms of the loss-share arrangements, the FDIC’s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to covered assets began with the first dollar of loss incurred. The FDIC reimbursed BPPR for 80% of losses with respect to covered assets, and BPPR reimbursed the FDIC for 80% of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid reimbursement under loss-share arrangements. The loss-share component of the arrangements applicable to commercial (including construction) and consumer loans expired during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, but the arrangement provided for reimbursement of recoveries to the FDIC to continue through the quarter ending June 30, 2018, and for the single family mortgage loss-share component of such agreement to expire in the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
As of March 31, 2018, the Corporation had an FDIC loss share asset of $45.6 million, net of amounts owed to the FDIC of $1.1 million, related to the covered assets. As part of the loss- share agreements, BPPR had agreed to make a true-up payment to the FDIC 45 days following the last day (such day, the “true-up measurement date”) of the final shared-loss month, or

          upon the final disposition of all covered assets under the loss- share agreements, in the event losses on the loss-share agreements fail to reach expected levels. The estimated fair value of such true-up payment obligation at March 31, 2018 was approximately $171 million (December 31, 2017 - $165 million) and was included as a contingent consideration within the caption of other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
On May 22, 2018, the Corporation entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with the FDIC to terminate all loss-share arrangements in connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, BPPR made a payment of approximately $23.7 million (the “Termination Payment”) to the FDIC as consideration for the termination of the loss-share agreements. Popular recorded a gain of $102.8 million within the FDIC loss share income (expense) caption in the Consolidated Statements of Operations calculated based on the difference between the Termination Payment and the net amount of the true-up payment obligation and the FDIC loss share asset.
The following table sets forth the activity in the FDIC loss- share asset for the periods presented.

As a result of the Termination Agreement, assets that were covered by the loss share agreement, including covered loans in the amount of approximately $514.6 million and covered real estate owned assets in the amount of approximately $15.3 million as of March 31, 2018, were reclassified as non-covered. The Corporation now recognizes entirely all future credit losses, expenses, gains, and recoveries related to the formerly covered assets with no offset due to or from the FDIC.

Note 12 - Transfers of financial assets and mortgage servicing assets
The Corporation typically transfers conforming residential mortgage loans in conjunction with GNMA and FNMA securitization transactions whereby the loans are exchanged for cash or securities and servicing rights. As seller, the Corporation has made certain representations and warranties with respect to the originally transferred loans and, in the past, has sold certain loans with credit recourse to a government- sponsored entity, namely FNMA. Refer to Note 24 to the

No liabilities were incurred as a result of these securitizations during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 because they did not contain any credit recourse arrangements. The Corporation recorded a net gain of $8.9 million and $15.2 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 related to the residential mortgage loans securitized.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation retained servicing rights on whole loan sales involving approximately $57 million in principal balance outstanding (2017 - $49 million), with net realized gains of approximately $0.8 million (2017 - $1.7 million). All loan sales performed during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were without credit recourse agreements.
The Corporation recognizes as assets the rights to service loans for others, whether these rights are purchased or result from asset transfers such as sales and securitizations. These mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) are measured at fair value.
The Corporation uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of MSRs. The discounted cash flow model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, prepayment and late fees, among other considerations. Prepayment speeds are adjusted for the Corporation’s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior.

 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 117

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were $15.7 billion at December 31, 2018 (2017 - $16.1 billion).
Net mortgage servicing fees, a component of mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, include the changes from period to period in the fair value of the MSRs, including changes due to collection / realization of expected cash flows. The banking subsidiaries receive servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding loan balance. These servicing fees are credited to income when they are collected. At December 31, 2018, those weighted average mortgage servicing fees were 0.30% (2017 - 0.28%). Under these servicing agreements, the banking subsidiaries do not generally earn significant prepayment penalty fees on the underlying loans serviced.
The section below includes information on assumptions used in the valuation model of the MSRs, originated and purchased.
Key economic assumptions used in measuring the servicing rights derived from loans securitized or sold by the Corporation during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:
  Prepayment speed Weighted average life
(in years)
Discount rate (annual rate)
Years ended December31,2018 December31,2017
5.0% 4.5%
10.8 10.8 11.0% 11.0%
 Key economic assumptions used to estimate the fair value of MSRs derived from sales and securitizations of mortgage loans performed by the banking subsidiaries and servicing rights purchased from other financial institutions, and the sensitivity to immediate changes in those assumptions, were as follows as of the end of the periods reported:
Originated MSRs

Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change Weighted average discount rate (annual rate)
Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change
The sensitivity analyses presented in the tables above for servicing rights are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10 and 20 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the sensitivity tables included herein, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation serviced $1.3 billion (2017 - $1.5 billion) in residential mortgage loans with credit recourse to the Corporation.
Under the GNMA securitizations, the Corporation, as servicer, has the right to repurchase (but not the obligation), at its option and without GNMA’s prior authorization, any loan that is collateral for a GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed security when certain delinquency criteria are met.

criteria and are eligible for repurchase, the Corporation is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans if the Corporation was the pool issuer. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had recorded $134 million in mortgage loans on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition related to this buy-back option program (2017 - $840 million). As long as the Corporation continues to service the loans that continue to be collateral in a GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed security, the MSR is recognized by the Corporation. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation repurchased approximately $321 million of mortgage loans under the GNMA buy-back option program (2017 - $160 million). The determination to repurchase these loans was based on the economic benefits of the transaction, which results in a reduction of the servicing costs for these severely delinquent loans, mostly related to principal and interest advances. Furthermore, the risk associated with these loans is reduced due to their guaranteed nature. The Corporation places these loans under its loss mitigation programs and once brought back to current status, these may be either retained in portfolio or re-sold in the secondary market.

Results of the Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
$9,140 5,065 2,254 1,378 1,338 1,494
second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles (including any unrecognized intangible assets, such as unrecognized core deposits and trademark) as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The Corporation estimates the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit, consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of the assets and liabilities reflects market conditions, thus volatility in prices could have a material impact on the determination of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill at the impairment test date. The adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated statement of condition. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards.
The Corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization during the third quarter of 2018 using July 31, 2018 as the annual evaluation date. The
   The Corporation’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment, at least annually and on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place. Such events could include, among others, a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator, an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit.
Under applicable accounting standards, goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The
122 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

reporting units utilized for this evaluation were those that are one level below the business segments, which are the legal entities within the reportable segment. The Corporation follows push-down accounting, as such all goodwill is assigned to the reporting units when carrying out a business combination.
In determining the fair value of a reporting unit, the Corporation generally uses a combination of methods, including market price multiples of comparable companies and transactions, as well as discounted cash flow analysis. Management evaluates the particular circumstances of each reporting unit in order to determine the most appropriate valuation methodology. The Corporation evaluates the results obtained under each valuation methodology to identify and understand the key value drivers in order to ascertain that the results obtained are reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Elements considered include current market and economic conditions, developments in specific lines of business, and any particular features in the individual reporting units.
The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:
• a selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on nature of business, location and size;
• a selection of comparable acquisition and capital raising transactions;
• the discount rate applied to future earnings, based on an estimate of the cost of equity;
• the potential future earnings of the reporting unit; and
• the market growth and new business assumptions.
For purposes of the market comparable approach, valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant value drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the reporting unit being analyzed and applying those price multiples to the value drivers of the reporting unit. Multiples used are minority based multiples and thus, no control premium adjustment is made to the comparable companies market multiples. While the market price multiple is not an assumption, a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation. The determination of the market comparables also involves a degree of judgment.
For purposes of the discounted cash flows (“DCF”) approach, the valuation is based on estimated future cash flows. The financial projections used in the DCF valuation analysis for each reporting unit are based on the most recent (as of the valuation date) financial projections presented to the Corporation’s Asset / Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”). The growth assumptions included in these projections are based on management’s expectations for each reporting unit’s financial prospects considering economic and
industry conditions as well as particular plans of each entity (i.e. restructuring plans, de-leveraging, etc.). The cost of equity used to discount the cash flows was calculated using the Ibbotson Build-Up Method and ranged from 11.42% to 13.93% for the 2018 analysis. The Ibbotson Build-Up Method builds up a cost of equity starting with the rate of return of a “risk-free” asset (20-year U.S. Treasury note) and adds to it additional risk elements such as equity risk premium, size premium and industry risk premium. The resulting discount rates were analyzed in terms of reasonability given the current market conditions and adjustments were made when necessary.
BPPR passed Step 1 in the annual test as of July 31, 2018. The results indicated that the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded BPPR’s equity value by approximately $2.4 billion or 77%. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment on the goodwill recorded in BPPR at July 31, 2018 and there was no need for a Step 2 analysis.
PB also passed Step 1 in the annual test as of July 31, 2018. The results indicated that the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded PB’s equity value by approximately $407 million or 28%. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment on the goodwill recorded in PB at July 31, 2018 and there was no need for a Step 2 analysis.
The goodwill balance of BPPR and PB, as legal entities, represented approximately 98% of the Corporation’s total goodwill balance as of the July 31, 2018 valuation date.
Furthermore, as part of the analyses, management performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values determined for the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Corporation concluding that the fair value results determined for the reporting units in the July 31, 2018 annual assessment were reasonable.
The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires the Corporation to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact the Corporation’s results of operations and the reporting units where the goodwill is recorded. Declines in the Corporation’s market capitalization could increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future.
Management monitors events or changes in circumstances between annual tests to determine if these events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

The Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the “NASDAQ”) under the symbol BPOP. The 2003 Series A and 2008 Series B Preferred Stock are not listed on NASDAQ.
The Corporation’s common stock ranks junior to all series of preferred stock as to dividend rights and / or as to rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. Dividends on each series of preferred stocks are payable if declared. The Corporation’s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Corporation fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the preferred stock for the latest dividend period. The ability of the Corporation to pay dividends in the future is limited by regulatory requirements, legal availability of funds, recent and projected financial results, capital levels and liquidity of the
Corporation, general business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.
On January 23, 2017, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.25 per share. During the year 2018, cash dividends of $1.00 (2017 - $1.00; 2016 - $0.60) per common share outstanding were declared amounting to $101.3 million (2017 - $102.1 million; 2016 - $62.2 million) of which $25.1 million were payable to shareholders of common stock at December 31, 2018 (2017 - $25.5 million; 2016 - $15.6 million). The quarterly dividend declared to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2018, was paid on January 2, 2019.
During the first quarter of 2017, the Corporation completed a $75 million privately negotiated accelerated share repurchase transaction (“ASR”). As part of this transaction, the Corporation received 1,847,372 shares and recognized $79.5 million in treasury stock, based on the stock’s spot price, offset by a $4.5 million adjustment to capital surplus, resulting from the decline in the Corporation’s stock price during the term of the ASR.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Corporation completed a $125 million ASR. In connection therewith, the Corporation had received an initial delivery of 2,000,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter of 2018 and received 438,180 additional shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2018. The final number of shares delivered at settlement was based on the average daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of its common stock, net of a discount, during the term of the ASR of $51.27.
On January 23, 2019, the Corporation announced the following actions as part of its capital plan for 2019: (i) an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, subject to approval by its Board of Directors, and (ii) up to $250 million in common stock repurchases. On February 15, 2019, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on its outstanding common stock, payable on April 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2019.
The Banking Act of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires that a minimum of 10% of BPPR’s net income for the year be transferred to a statutory reserve account until such statutory reserve equals the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. Any losses incurred by a bank must first be charged to retained earnings and then to the reserve fund. Amounts credited to the reserve fund may not be used to pay dividends without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The failure to maintain sufficient statutory reserves would preclude BPPR from paying dividends. BPPR’s statutory reserve fund amounted to $599 million at December 31, 2018 (2017 - $540 million; 2016 - $513 million). During 2018, $58 million was transferred

to the statutory reserve account (2017 - $27 million, 2016 - $18 million). BPPR was in compliance with the statutory reserve requirement in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Note 22 - Regulatory capital requirements
The Corporation, BPPR and PB are subject to various regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Popular Inc, BPPR and PB are subject to Basel III capital requirements, including also revised minimum and well capitalized regulatory capital ratios and compliance with the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets.
The Basel III Capital Rules established a Common Equity Tier I (“CET1”) capital measure and related regulatory capital ratio CET1 to risk-weighted assets.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide that a depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintained a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk- based ratio of at least 10%. Management has determined that at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
The Corporation has been designated by the Federal Reserve Board as a Financial Holding Company (“FHC”) and is eligible to engage in certain financial activities permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, BPPR and PB were well- capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
The following tables present the Corporation’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios at December 31, 2018 and 2017 under the Basel III regulatory guidance.

The following table presents the minimum amounts and ratios for the Corporation’s banks to be categorized as well- capitalized.
The final Basel III capital rules require the phase out of non-qualifying Tier 1 capital instruments such as trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2018 the Corporation had $374 million in trust preferred securities outstanding which does not qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment, but instead qualified for Tier 2 capital treatment.
The Basel III final rules also includes a phase-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that is effectively layered on top of the minimum capital risk-based ratios, which places restrictions on the amount of retained earnings that may be used for distributions or discretionary bonus payments as risk-based capital ratios approach their respective “adequately capitalized minimums.”

Note 24 - Guarantees
The Corporation has obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual agreements as summarized below.
The Corporation issues financial standby letters of credit and has risk participation in standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to guarantee the performance of various customers to third parties. If the customers failed to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract, then, upon their request, the Corporation would be obligated to make the payment to the guaranteed party. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation recorded a liability of $0.3 million (December 31, 2017 - $0.3 million), which represents the unamortized balance of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantees under the standby letters of credit.

These fees are deferred and are recognized over the commitment period. The contracted amounts in standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, shown in Note 25, represent the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Corporation could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the customers. These standby letters of credit are used by the customers as a credit enhancement and typically expire without being drawn upon. The Corporation’s standby letters of credit are generally secured, and in the event of nonperformance by the customers, the Corporation has rights to the underlying collateral provided, which normally includes cash, marketable securities, real estate, receivables, and others. Management does not anticipate any material losses related to these instruments.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 133

Also, from time to time, the Corporation securitized mortgage loans into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities subject in certain instances, to lifetime credit recourse on the loans that serve as collateral for the mortgage-backed securities. The Corporation has not sold any mortgage loans subject to credit recourse since 2009. Also, from time to time, the Corporation may sell, in bulk sale transactions, residential mortgage loans and Small Business Administration (“SBA”) commercial loans subject to credit recourse or to certain representations and warranties from the Corporation to the purchaser. These representations and warranties may relate, for example, to borrower creditworthiness, loan documentation, collateral, prepayment and early payment defaults. The Corporation may be required to repurchase the loans under the credit recourse agreements or representation and warranties.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation serviced $1.3 billion (December 31, 2017 - $1.5 billion) in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with FNMA and FHLMC residential mortgage loan securitization programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Corporation is required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Corporation would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2018, the Corporation repurchased approximately $ 27 million of unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions (2017 - $ 29 million). In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, the Corporation has rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. The Corporation suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing the related property. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $ 56 million (December 31, 2017 - $ 59 million). The following table shows the changes in the Corporation’s liability of estimated losses from these credit recourses agreements, included in the consolidated statements of financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The estimated losses to be absorbed under the credit recourse arrangements are recorded as a liability when the loans are sold and are updated by accruing or reversing expense (categorized in the line item “Adjustments (expense) to indemnity reserves on loans sold” in the consolidated statements of operations) throughout the life of the loan, as necessary, when additional relevant information becomes available. The methodology used to estimate the recourse liability is a function of the recourse arrangements given and considers a variety of factors, which include actual defaults and historical loss experience, foreclosure rate, estimated future defaults and the probability that a loan would be delinquent. Statistical methods are used to estimate the recourse liability. Expected loss rates are applied to different loan segmentations. The expected loss, which represents the amount expected to be lost on a given loan, considers the probability of default and loss severity. The probability of default represents the probability that a loan in good standing would become 90 days delinquent within the following twelve-month period. Regression analysis quantifies the relationship between the default event and loan-specific characteristics, including credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, and loan aging, among others.
When the Corporation sells or securitizes mortgage loans, it generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold. The Corporation’s mortgage operations in Puerto Rico group conforming mortgage loans into pools which are exchanged for FNMA and GNMA mortgage-backed securities, which are generally sold to private investors, or are sold directly to FNMA for cash. As required under the government agency programs, quality review procedures are performed by the Corporation to ensure that asset guideline qualifications are met. To the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics, the Corporation may be required to repurchase such loans or indemnify for losses and bear any subsequent loss related to the loans. There were $12 million in repurchases under BPPR’s representation and warranty arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. A substantial amount of these loans reinstate to performing status or have mortgage insurance, and thus the ultimate losses on the loans are not deemed significant.

Note 25 - Commitments and contingencies
Off-balance sheet risk
The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers. These financial instruments include loan commitments, letters of credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual notional amounts of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making these commitments and conditional obligations as it does for those reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

   Servicing agreements relating to the mortgage-backed securities programs of FNMA and GNMA, and to mortgage loans sold or serviced to certain other investors, including FHLMC, require the Corporation to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation serviced $15.7 billion in mortgage loans for third-parties, including the loans serviced with credit recourse (December 31, 2017 - $16.1 billion). The Corporation generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements from the mortgage owner, from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed or, in the case of FHA/VA loans, under the applicable FHA and VA insurance and guarantees programs. However, in the meantime, the Corporation must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding. The Corporation must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition, if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the Corporation would not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of funds advanced by the Corporation under such mortgage loan servicing agreements was approximately $88 million (December 31, 2017 - $107 million). To the extent the mortgage loans underlying the Corporation’s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies, the Corporation would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts.

Business concentration
Since the Corporation’s business activities are concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, its results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration of the
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 135

Corporation’s operations in Puerto Rico exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base. Its asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in Note 39 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Puerto Rico remains in the midst of a profound fiscal and economic crisis. In response to such crisis, the U.S. Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in 2016, which, among other things, established a Fiscal Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the “Oversight Board”) and a framework for the restructuring of the debts of the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities and municipalities. The Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities have commenced debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. As of the date of this report, no municipality has commenced, or has been authorized by the Oversight Board to commence, any such debt restructuring proceeding under PROMESA.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and
municipalities totaled $458 million, which was fully outstanding at year end (compared to a direct exposure of approximately $484 million, which was fully outstanding at December 31, 2017). Of this amount, $413 million consists of loans and $45 million are securities ($435 million and $49 million at December 31, 2017). Substantially all of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2018 was obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these are “general obligations” of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or “special obligations” of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At December 31, 2018, 75% of the Corporation’s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayamón.

In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $368 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($386 million at December 31, 2017). These included $293 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (“HFA”), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2017 - $310 million).

mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and subsequent foreclosure of the underlying property. The Corporation also had at December 31, 2018, $45 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and subsequent foreclosure of the underlying property (December 31, 2017 - $44 million). In the event that

the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA’s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, he has not exercised this power as of the date hereof. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $7 million in securities issued by HFA that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of U.S. agencies and Treasury obligations have been escrowed (December 31, 2017 - $7 million), and $23 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non- governmental parties (December 31, 2017 - $25 million).
BPPR’s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and the ongoing Title III proceedings under PROMESA described above. Similarly, BPPR’s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs.
The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the “USVI”) and has approximately $76 million in direct exposure to USVI government entities. The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations.
Legal Proceedings
The nature of Popular’s business ordinarily results in a certain number of claims, litigation, investigations, and legal and administrative cases and proceedings (“Legal Proceedings”). When the Corporation determines that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted, it vigorously defends itself. The Corporation will consider the settlement of cases (including cases where it has meritorious defenses) when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interest of both the Corporation and its shareholders to do so. On at least a quarterly basis, Popular assesses its liabilities and contingencies relating to outstanding Legal Proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For matters where it is probable that the Corporation will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Corporation establishes an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual is adjusted on at least a quarterly basis as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments. For matters where a material loss is not
probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is established.
In certain cases, exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible, but not probable. Management believes and estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (with respect to those matters where such limits may be determined, in excess of amounts accrued), for current Legal Proceedings ranges from $0 to approximately $27.1 million as of December 31, 2018. For certain other cases, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time. Any estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the Legal Proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current Legal Proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in many of the Legal Proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such Legal Proceedings. Accordingly, management’s estimate will change from time-to-time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.
While the outcome of Legal Proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the Legal Proceedings in matters in which a loss amount can be reasonably estimated will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters in a reporting period, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position for that particular period.
Set forth below is a description of the Corporation’s significant Legal Proceedings.
BANCO POPULAR DE PUERTO RICO
Hazard Insurance Commission-Related Litigation
Popular, Inc., BPPR and Popular Insurance, LLC (the “Popular Defendants”) have been named defendants in a putative class action complaint captioned Pérez Díaz v. Popular, Inc., et al, filed before the Court of First Instance, Arecibo Part. The complaint seeks damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief on behalf of the purported class against the Popular Defendants, as well as Antilles Insurance Company and MAPFRE-PRAICO Insurance Company (the “Defendant Insurance Companies”). Plaintiffs allege that the Popular Defendants have been unjustly enriched by failing to reimburse them for commissions paid by the Defendant Insurance Companies to the insurance agent and/or mortgagee for policy years when no claims were filed against their hazard insurance policies. They demand the reimbursement to the purported “class” of an estimated $400 million plus legal interest, for the
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 137

“good experience” commissions allegedly paid by the Defendant Insurance Companies during the relevant time period, as well as injunctive relief seeking to enjoin the Defendant Insurance Companies from paying commissions to the insurance agent/mortgagee and ordering them to pay those fees directly to the insured. A motion for dismissal on the merits, which the Defendant Insurance Companies filed shortly before hearing, was denied with a right to replead following limited targeted discovery. The Court of Appeals and then the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, both denied the Popular Defendants’ request to review the lower court’s denial of the motion to dismiss. On December 21, 2017, plaintiffs sought to amend the complaint and, on January 2018, defendants filed an answer thereto. Separately, on October 26, 2017, the Court entered an order whereby it broadly certified the class after which the Popular Defendants filed a certiorari petition before the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals in relation to the class certification, which the Court declined to entertain. The parties have not yet reached an agreement as to the class notification procedures. On November 14, 2018 and on January 30, 2019, Plaintiffs filed voluntary dismissal petitions against MAPFRE- PRAICO Insurance Company and Antilles Insurance Company, respectively. Hence, now the Popular Defendants remain the sole defendants in this action. A status and settlement conference is scheduled for March 27, 2019.
BPPR has separately been named a defendant in a putative class action complaint captioned Ramirez Torres, et al. v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, et al, filed before the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan Part. The complaint seeks damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief on behalf of the purported class against the same Popular Defendants, as well as other financial institutions with insurance brokerage subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs essentially contend that in November 2015, Antilles Insurance Company obtained approval from the Puerto Rico Insurance Commissioner to market an endorsement that allowed its customers to obtain reimbursement on their insurance deductible for good experience, but that defendants failed to offer this product or disclose its existence to their customers, favoring other products instead, in violation of their duties as insurance brokers. Plaintiffs seek a determination that defendants unlawfully failed to comply with their duty to disclose the existence of this new insurance product, as well as double or treble damages (the latter subject to a determination that defendants engaged in anti-monopolistic practices in failing to offer this product). Between late March and early April of 2017, co-defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint and opposed the request for preliminary injunctive relief. A co-defendant filed a third-party Complaint against Antilles Insurance Company. A preliminary injunction and class certification hearing originally scheduled for April 6, 2017 was subsequently postponed, pending resolution of the motions to dismiss. On July 2017, the Court dismissed the complaint with
prejudice. In August 2017, plaintiffs appealed this judgment and, on March 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed the Court of First Instance’s dismissal. On May 2018, all defendants filed their respective Petitions of Certiorari to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which denied review. The case is pending scheduling of status conference, class certification or injunctive relief hearings.
Mortgage-Related Litigation and Claims
BPPR has been named a defendant in a putative class action captioned Lilliam González Camacho, et al. v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, et al., filed before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on behalf of mortgage-holders who have allegedly been subjected to illegal foreclosures and/or loan modifications through their mortgage servicers. Plaintiffs maintain that when they sought to reduce their loan payments, defendants failed to provide them with such reduced loan payments, instead subjecting them to lengthy loss mitigation processes while filing foreclosure claims against them in parallel (or dual tracking). Plaintiffs assert that such actions violate the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”), the Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”) and other federally sponsored loan modification programs, as well as the Puerto Rico Mortgage Debtor Assistance Act and the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”). For the alleged violations stated above, plaintiffs request that all defendants (over 20, including all local banks), be held jointly and severally liable in an amount no less than $400 million. BPPR waived service of process in June 2017 and filed a motion to dismiss in August 2017, as did most co-defendants. On March 2018, the District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety. After being denied reconsideration by the District Court, on August 2018, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On January 22, 2019, the Appellants filed their brief. Appellees’ filed a request for extension of time to file their brief, which if granted, would become due on March 27, 2019.
BPPR has also been named a defendant in another putative class action captioned Yiries Josef Saad Maura v. Banco Popular, et al., filed by the same counsel who filed the González Camacho action referenced above, on behalf of residential customers of the defendant banks who have allegedly been subject to illegal foreclosures and/or loan modifications through their mortgage servicers. As in González Camacho, plaintiffs contend that when they sought to reduce their loan payments, defendants failed to provide them with such reduced loan payments, instead subjecting them to lengthy loss mitigation processes while filing foreclosure claims against them in parallel, all in violation of TILA, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and other consumer- protection laws and regulations. Plaintiffs did not include a specific amount of damages in their complaint. After waiving
138 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

service of process, BPPR filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the same grounds as those asserted in the González Camacho action (as did most co-defendants, separately). BPPR further filed a motion to oppose class certification, which the Court granted, denying the motion for class certification in September 2018. In October 2018, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration of such denial, which BPPR opposed. Those motions are still pending.
BPPR has been named a defendant in a complaint for damages and breach of contract captioned Héctor Robles Rodriguez et al. v. Municipio de Ceiba, et al. Plaintiffs are residents of a development called Hacienda Las Lomas. Through the Doral Bank-FDIC assisted transaction, BPPR acquired a significant number of mortgage loans within this development and is currently the primary mortgage lender in the project. Plaintiffs claim damages against the developer, contractor, the relevant insurance companies, and most recently, their mortgage lenders, because of a landslide that occurred in October 2015, affecting various streets and houses within the development. Plaintiffs specifically allege that the mortgage lenders, including BPPR, should be deemed liable for their alleged failure to properly inspect the subject properties. Plaintiffs demand $30 million in damages plus attorney’s fees, costs and the annulment of their mortgages. BPPR extended plaintiffs four consecutive six-month payment forbearances, the last of which is still in effect, and it is engaged in settlement discussions with plaintiffs. In November 2017, the FDIC notified BPPR that it had agreed to indemnify the Bank in connection with its Doral Bank-related exposure, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Purchase and Assumption Agreement with the FDIC. The FDIC filed a Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (“USDC”) on March 2018 and, on April 2018, the state court stayed the proceedings in response thereto. On October 18, 2018, the Court granted FDIC’s motion to stay the proceedings until plaintiffs have exhausted administrative remedies.
Mortgage-Related Investigations
The Corporation and its subsidiaries from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct. In particular, BPPR has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s Office of the Inspector General, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of the Inspector General mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. The Corporation is cooperating with these requests and is in discussions regarding the resolution of such matters. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of those discussions.
Separately, in July 2017, management learned that certain letters generated by the Corporation to comply with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) rules requiring written notification to borrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately three-years due to a systems interface error. Loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt. The loss mitigation process applies both to mortgage loans held by the Corporation and to mortgage loans serviced by the Corporation for third parties. The Corporation has corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent.
The Corporation notified applicable regulators and conducted a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact. The review found that while the mailing error extended to approximately 23,000 residential mortgage loans (approximately 50% of which are serviced by the Corporation for third parties), the number of borrowers actually harmed by the mailing error was substantially lower. This was due to, among other things, the fact that the Corporation regularly uses means other than the mail to communicate with borrowers, including email and hand delivery of written notices at our mortgage servicing centers or bank branches. Importantly, more than half of those borrowers potentially subject to such error actually closed on a loss mitigation alternative. Furthermore, the Corporation’s outreach and remediation efforts with respect to potentially affected borrowers are substantially complete.
The Corporation has also engaged in remediation with respect to other printing and mailings incidents and other servicing matters in its mortgage servicing operation.
The Corporation is engaged in ongoing dialogue with applicable regulators with respect to the aforementioned mortgage servicing matters and there can be no assurances as to the outcome thereof. At this point, we are not able to estimate the financial impact of the foregoing.
Other Significant Proceedings
In June 2017, a syndicate comprised of BPPR and other local banks (the “Lenders”) filed an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding against Betteroads Asphalt and Betterecycling Corporation (the “Involuntary Debtors”). This filing followed attempts by the Lenders to restructure and resolve the Involuntary Debtors’ obligations and outstanding defaults under a certain credit agreement, first through good faith negotiations and subsequently, through the filing of a collection action against the Involuntary Debtors in local court. The involuntary debtors subsequently counterclaimed, asserting damages in excess of $900 million. The Lenders ultimately joined in the commencement of these involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the Debtors in order to preserve and recover the Involuntary Debtors’ assets, having
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 139

confirmed that the Involuntary Debtors were transferring assets out of their estate for little or no consideration. The Involuntary Debtors subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings and for damages against the syndicate, arguing both that this petition was filed in bad faith and that there was a bona fide dispute as to the petitioners’ claims, as set forth in the counterclaim filed by the Involuntary Debtors in local court. The court allowed limited discovery to take place prior to an evidentiary hearing to determine the merits of debtors’ motion to dismiss.
On November 30, 2018, the Court issued an order where it ruled that: (1) the Lenders, as petitioning creditors, satisfied the three-prong requirement for filing an involuntary petition; (2) nonetheless, bad faith is an independent cause for dismissal of an involuntary petition under section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (3) the Involuntary Debtors failed to show that dismissal pursuant to section 305(a)(1) abstention is in the best interest of both the creditors and the debtors. An evidentiary hearing is set for May 23, 2019 to consider whether or not the involuntary petitions were filed in bad faith, that is, for an improper purpose that constitutes an abuse of the bankruptcy process.
POPULAR SECURITIES
Puerto Rico Bonds and Closed-End Investment Funds
The volatility in prices and declines in value that Puerto Rico municipal bonds and closed-end investment companies that invest primarily in Puerto Rico municipal bonds have experienced since August 2013 have led to regulatory inquiries, customer complaints and arbitrations for most broker-dealers in Puerto Rico, including Popular Securities. Popular Securities has received customer complaints and is named as a respondent (among other broker-dealers) in 169 arbitration proceedings with aggregate claimed amounts of approximately $201 million, including one arbitration with claimed damages of approximately $30 million. While Popular Securities believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in these proceedings, it has often determined that it is in its best interest to settle certain claims rather than expend the money and resources required to see such cases to completion. The Puerto Rico Government’s defaults and non-payment of its various debt obligations, as well as the Commonwealth’s and the Financial Oversight Management Board’s (the “Oversight Board”) decision to pursue restructurings under Title III and Title VI of PROMESA, have increased and may continue to increase the number of customer complaints (and claimed damages) filed against Popular Securities concerning Puerto Rico bonds and closed-end investment companies that invest primarily in Puerto Rico bonds. An adverse result in the arbitration proceedings described above, or a significant increase in customer complaints, could have a material adverse effect on Popular.
Subpoenas for Production of Documents in relation to PROMESA Title III Proceedings
Popular Securities has, together with Popular, Inc. and BPPR (collectively, the “Popular Companies”) filed an appearance in connection with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico’s pending Title III bankruptcy proceeding. Its appearance was prompted by a request by the Commonwealth’s Unsecured Creditors’ Committee (“UCC”) to allow a broad discovery program under Rule 2004 to investigate, among other things, the causes of the Puerto Rico financial crisis. The Rule 2004 request sought broad discovery not only from the Popular Companies, but also from others, spanning in excess of eleven (11) years. The Oversight Board, as well as the Popular Companies and others, opposed the UCC’s request. Magistrate Dein denied the UCC’s request without prejudice and allowed the law firm of Kobre & Kim to carry out its own independent investigation on behalf of the Oversight Board.
The Popular Companies have separately been served with additional requests for the preservation and voluntary production of certain documents and witnesses from the UCC and the COFINA Agents in connection with the COFINA- Commonwealth adversary complaint, as well as from the Oversight Board’s Independent Investigator, Kobre & Kim, with respect to its independent investigation. The Popular Companies cooperated with all such requests and asked that such requests be submitted in the form of a subpoena to address privacy and confidentiality considerations pertaining to some of the documents involved in the production.
On August 20, 2018, Kobre & Kim issued its Final Report, which contained various references to the Popular Companies, including allegations that Popular Securities participated as an underwriter in Commonwealth’s 2014 issuance of government obligation bonds notwithstanding having allegedly advised against it. The report discussed that such allegation could give rise to an unjust enrichment claim against the Popular Companies and could also serve as a basis to equitably subordinate any claim it files in the Title III proceeding to other claims. The Oversight Board also created a special claims committee as a result of the Final Report and such committee, along with the UCC, filed in January 14, 2019 a joint objection seeking the disallowance of more than $6 billion in Commonwealth G.O. bonds issued in or after March 2012, including issuances in which Popular Securities participated as underwriter, alleging that such bonds were unconstitutional.
Note 26 - Non-consolidated variable interest entities
The Corporation is involved with three statutory trusts which it established to issue trust preferred securities to the public. These trusts are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) since the equity investors at risk have no substantial decision- making rights. The Corporation does not hold any variable interest in the trusts, and therefore, cannot be the trusts’ primary beneficiary. Furthermore, the Corporation concluded
140 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

that it did not hold a controlling financial interest in these trusts since the decisions of the trusts are predetermined through the trust documents and the guarantee of the trust preferred securities is irrelevant since in substance the sponsor is guaranteeing its own debt.
Also, the Corporation is involved with various special purpose entities mainly in guaranteed mortgage securitization transactions, including GNMA and FNMA. These special purpose entities are deemed to be VIEs since they lack equity investments at risk. The Corporation’s continuing involvement in these guaranteed loan securitizations includes owning certain beneficial interests in the form of securities as well as the servicing rights retained. The Corporation is not required to provide additional financial support to any of the variable interest entities to which it has transferred the financial assets. The mortgage-backed securities, to the extent retained, are classified in the Corporation’s consolidated statements of financial condition as available-for-sale or trading securities. The Corporation concluded that, essentially, these entities (FNMA and GNMA) control the design of their respective VIEs, dictate the quality and nature of the collateral, require the underlying insurance, set the servicing standards via the servicing guides and can change them at will, and can remove a primary servicer with cause, and without cause in the case of FNMA. Moreover, through their guarantee obligations, agencies (FNMA and GNMA) have the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
The Corporation holds variable interests in these VIEs in the form of agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, including those securities originated by the Corporation and those acquired from third parties. Additionally, the Corporation holds agency mortgage-backed securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations and private label collateralized mortgage obligations issued by third party VIEs in which it has no other form of continuing involvement. Refer to Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, which are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities in the Corporation’s consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Corporation holds variable interests in the form of servicing fees, since it retains the right to service the transferred loans in those government-sponsored special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and may also purchase the right to service loans in other government-sponsored SPEs that were transferred to those SPEs by a third-party.
The following table presents the carrying amount and classification of the assets related to the Corporation’s variable interests in non-consolidated VIEs and the maximum exposure
to loss as a result of the Corporation’s involvement as servicer of GNMA and FNMA loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

       The size of the non-consolidated VIEs, in which the Corporation has a variable interest in the form of servicing fees, measured as the total unpaid principal balance of the loans, amounted to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $11.7 billion).
The Corporation determined that the maximum exposure to loss includes the fair value of the MSRs and the assumption that the servicing advances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 will not be recovered. The agency debt securities are not included as part of the maximum exposure to loss since they are guaranteed by the related agencies.
In September of 2011, BPPR sold construction and commercial real estate loans to a newly created joint venture, PRLP 2011 Holdings, LLC. In March of 2013, BPPR completed a sale of commercial and construction loans, and commercial and single family real estate owned to a newly created joint venture, PR Asset Portfolio 2013-1 International, LLC.
These joint ventures were created for the limited purpose of acquiring the loans from BPPR; servicing the loans through a third-party servicer; ultimately working out, resolving and/or foreclosing the loans; and indirectly owning, operating, constructing, developing, leasing and selling any real properties acquired by the joint ventures through deed in lieu of foreclosure, foreclosure, or by resolution of any loan.
BPPR provided financing to PRLP 2011 Holdings, LLC and PR Asset Portfolio 2013-1 International, LLC for the acquisition of the assets in an amount equal to the acquisition loan of $86 million and $182 million, respectively. The acquisition loans have a 5-year maturity and bear a variable interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 300 basis points and are secured by a pledge of all of the acquiring entity’s assets. In addition, BPPR provided these joint ventures with a non-revolving advance facility (the “advance facility”) of $69 million and $35 million, respectively, to cover unfunded commitments and costs-to-complete related to certain construction projects, and a revolving working capital line (the “working capital line”) of $20 million and $30 million, respectively, to fund certain
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 141

operating expenses of the joint venture. As part of these transactions, BPPR received $48 million and $92 million, respectively, in cash and a 24.9% equity interest in each joint venture. The Corporation is not required to provide any other financial support to these joint ventures.
BPPR accounted for both transactions as a true sale pursuant to ASC Subtopic 860-10.
The Corporation has determined that PRLP 2011 Holdings, LLC and PR Asset Portfolio 2013-1 International, LLC are VIEs but it is not the primary beneficiary. All decisions are made by Caribbean Property Group (“CPG”) (or an affiliate thereof) (the “Manager”), except for certain limited material decisions which would require the unanimous consent of all members. The Manager is authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the joint ventures any and all documents, contracts, certificates, agreements and instruments, and to take any action deemed necessary in the benefit of the joint ventures.
The Corporation holds variable interests in these VIEs in the form of the 24.9% equity interests and the financing provided to these joint ventures. The equity interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting pursuant to ASC Subtopic 323-10.
The following tables present the carrying amount and classification of the assets and liabilities related to the Corporation’s variable interests in the non-consolidated VIEs, PRLP 2011 Holdings, LLC and PR Asset Portfolio 2013- International, LLC, and their maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
involved with. The conclusion on the assessment of these non-consolidated VIEs has not changed since their initial evaluation. The Corporation concluded that it is still not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and therefore, these VIEs are not required to be consolidated in the Corporation’s financial statements at December 31, 2018.
Note 27 - Derivative instruments and hedging activities
The use of derivatives is incorporated as part of the Corporation’s overall interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain balance sheet assets and liabilities so that the net interest income is not materially affected by movements in interest rates. The Corporation uses derivatives in its trading activities to facilitate customer transactions, and as a means of risk management. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed and variable interest rate assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in fair value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation is expected to be substantially offset by the Corporation’s gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged assets and liabilities. As a matter of policy, the Corporation does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management.
Market risk is the adverse effect that a change in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or implied volatility rates might have on the value of a financial instrument. The Corporation manages the market risk associated with interest rates and, to a limited extent, with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by establishing and monitoring limits for the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken.
By using derivative instruments, the Corporation exposes itself to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Corporation’s credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative asset. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this indicates that the counterparty owes the Corporation, thus creating a repayment risk for the Corporation. To manage the level of credit risk, the Corporation deals with counterparties of good credit standing, enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and, when appropriate, obtains collateral. On the other hand, when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Corporation owes the counterparty and, therefore, the fair value of derivatives liabilities incorporates nonperformance risk or the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled.
The credit risk attributed to the counterparty’s nonperformance risk is incorporated in the fair value of the derivatives. Additionally, as required by the fair value measurements guidance, the fair value of the Corporation’s own

credit standing is considered in the fair value of the derivative liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, inclusion of the credit risk in the fair value of the derivatives resulted in a loss of $0.6 million from the Corporation’s credit standing adjustment. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation recognized a gain of $ 0.2 million and a loss of $ 0.9 million, respectively, from the Corporation’s credit standing adjustment and a loss of $ 0.1 million and a gain of $0.4 million, respectively, from the assessment of the counterparties’ credit risk.
The Corporation’s derivatives are subject to agreements which allow a right of set-off with each respective counterparty.
In an event of default each party has a right of set-off against the other party for amounts owed in the related agreement and any other amount or obligation owed in respect of any other agreement or transaction between them. Pursuant to the Corporation’s accounting policy, the fair value of derivatives is not offset with the fair value of other derivatives held with the same counterparty even if these agreements allow a right of set-off. In addition, the fair value of derivatives is not offset with the amounts for the right to reclaim financial collateral or the obligation to return financial collateral.
Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or non-hedging derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

Cash Flow Hedges
The Corporation utilizes forward contracts to hedge the sale of mortgage-backed securities with duration terms over one month. Interest rate forwards are contracts for the delayed delivery of securities, which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date at a specified price or yield. These forward contracts are hedging a forecasted transaction and thus qualify
for cash flow hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) corresponding to these forward contracts is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months. These contracts have a maximum remaining maturity of 80 days at December 31, 2018.
For cash flow hedges, net gains (losses) on derivative contracts that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current period earnings are included in the line item in which the hedged item is recorded and during the period in which the forecasted transaction impacts earnings, as presented in the tables below.

Forward Contracts
The Corporation has forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities, which are accounted for as trading derivatives. Changes in their fair value are recognized in mortgage banking activities.
Interest Rates Swaps and Foreign Currency and Exchange Rate Commitments
In addition to using derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation also utilizes derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts, in its capacity as an intermediary on behalf of its customers. The Corporation minimizes its market risk and credit risk by taking offsetting positions under the same terms and conditions with credit limit approvals and monitoring procedures. Market value changes on these swaps and other derivatives are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
Interest Rate Caps
The Corporation enters into interest rate caps as an intermediary on behalf of its customers and simultaneously takes offsetting positions under the same terms and conditions, thus minimizing its market and credit risks.
Indexed and Embedded Options
The Corporation offers certain customers’ deposits whose return are tied to the performance of the Standard and Poor’s (“S&P 500”) stock market indexes, and other deposits whose returns are tied to other stock market indexes or other equity securities performance. The Corporation bifurcated the related options embedded within these customers’ deposits from the host contract in accordance with ASC Subtopic 815-15. In order to limit the Corporation’s exposure to changes in these indexes, the Corporation purchases indexed options which returns are
tied to the same indexes from major broker dealer companies in the over the counter market. Accordingly, the embedded options and the related indexed options are marked-to-market through earnings.

In June 2006, family members of a director of the Corporation, obtained a $0.8 million mortgage loan from Popular Mortgage, Inc., now a division of BPPR, secured by a residential property. The director was not a director of the Corporation at the time the loan was made. In March, 2012 the loan was restructured under BPPR’s loss mitigation program. During 2017, the borrower defaulted on his payment obligations under the restructured loan and as of December 31, 2018 the loan was 670 days past due. The balance due on the loan at December 31, 2018 was approximately $0.9 million.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 145

In 2010, as part of the Westernbank FDIC assisted transaction, BPPR acquired (i) four commercial loans made to entities that were wholly owned by one brother-in-law of a director of the Corporation and (ii) one commercial loan made to an entity that was owned by the same brother-in-law together with this director’s father-in-law and another brother- in-law. The loans were secured by real estate and personally guaranteed by the owners of each entity. The loans were originated by Westernbank between 2001 and 2005 and had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $33.5 million when they were acquired by BPPR in 2010. Between 2011 and 2014, the loans were restructured to consist of (i) five notes with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $19.8 million with a 6% annual interest rate (“Notes A”) and (ii) five notes with an aggregate outstanding balance of $13.5 million with a 1% annual interest rate, to be paid upon maturity (“Notes B”). The restructured notes had a maturity of September 30, 2016 and, thereafter, various interim renewals were approved, with the last two renewals occurring in May and November 2018. The May renewal included a six-month payment plan reduction of principal and interest from $36 thousand to $5 thousand plus accrued interest commencing on January 2018 on one of the Notes A. The November 2018 renewal included a change in interest rate on all of the five Notes A and an increase in the monthly principal payments of the Note A that had been modified in May from $5 thousand to $10 thousand effective December 2018. The renewed loans mature on June 30, 2019. The aggregate outstanding balance of the loans as of December 31, 2018 was of approximately $31.7 million.
The brother of an executive officer of the Corporation and his wife have three outstanding loans, each secured by the borrowers’ principal residence, where BPPR acts as either lender or servicer. The aggregate original amount of these loans was of $0.7 million, comprised of one mortgage loan of approximately $0.5 million, which is owned by a third-party investor and in which BPPR is the servicer, one mortgage loan of $0.1 million secured by a second mortgage and another mortgage loan of $0.1 million secured by a third mortgage. As of December 31, 2018 the borrowers were in default with their respective obligations under all of these loan agreements. In February 2019, and pursuant to the terms of the Related Party Policy, the Audit Committee approved a series of transactions related to the aforementioned mortgages. With respect to the first mortgage, the parties will enter into a deed in lieu of foreclosure pursuant to which the property will be transferred to the investor free and clear of liens. In connection therewith, BPPR will also release the second and third mortgages over the residential property, subject to the following conditions. The borrowers will be required to make a cash contribution of $20 thousand to reduce the principal amount of the second mortgage loan and issue, for the benefit of BPPR, a promissory note in the amount of $82 thousand in order to grant BPPR the
right to collect from borrowers the balance of such debt. With respect to the third mortgage loan, the borrowers will issue an unsecured promissory note with a maturity date of June 30, 2019 that will benefit from a corporate guaranty from the entity under which the Corporation’s brother operates a property appraisal business. Borrowers will be required to make monthly payments of $500 until the maturity date of the promissory note, when the financial capacity of borrowers will be re-evaluated, and a new payment plan is expected to be entered into.
In April 2010, in connection with the acquisition of the Westernbank assets from the FDIC, as receiver, BPPR acquired a term loan to a corporate borrower partially owned by an investment corporation in which the Corporation’s Executive Chairman, at that time the Chief Executive Officer, as well as certain of his family members, are the owners. In addition, the officer’s sister and brother-in-law are owners of an entity that holds an ownership interest in the borrower. At the time the loan was acquired by BPPR, it had an unpaid principal balance of $40.2 million. In May 2017, this loan was sold by BPPR to Popular, Inc., holding company (“PIHC”). At the time of sale, the loan had an unpaid principal balance of $37.9 million. PIHC paid $37.9 million to BPPR for the loan, of which $6.0 million was recognized by BPPR as a capital contribution representing the difference between the fair value and the book value of the loan at the time of transfer. Immediately upon being acquired by PIHC, the loan’s maturity was extended by 90 days (under the same terms as originally contracted) to provide the PIHC additional time to evaluate a refinancing or long-term extension of the loan. In August 2017, the credit facility was refinanced with a stated maturity in February 2019. During 2017, the facility was subject to the loan payment moratorium offered as part of the hurricane relief efforts. As such, interest payments amounting to approximately $0.5 million were deferred and capitalized as part of the loan balance. In February 2019, the Audit Committee approved, under the Related Party Policy, a 36-month renewal of the loan at an interest rate of 5.75% and a 30-year amortization schedule. As of December 31, 2018, the unpaid principal balance amounted to $37.7 million.
On August 2018, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Reliable Financial Services and Reliable Finance Holding Company, Puerto Rico-based subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company engaged in the auto finance business in Puerto Rico. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this transaction. As part of the acquisition transaction, the Corporation agreed to enter in an agreement with Reliable Financial Services to sublease the space necessary to continue the acquired operations. Reliable Financial Services’ lease agreement is with the entity in which the Corporation’s Executive Chairman and his family members hold an ownership interest, described in the preceeding paragraph as having a loan with the Corporation. Since February 2018, the
146 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

lease agreement has been amended three times, most recently in January 2019 to reduce the square footage and rent payments due under the lease (and as a result, the sublease) as a result of the gradual transfer out of the building of the Corporation’s operations. Rents paid pursuant to the sublease will be a source of repayment of, and serve as collateral to, the commercial loan. During 2018, the Corporation paid to Reliable Financial Services approximately $0.8 million under the sublease.
The Corporation has had loan transactions with the Corporation’s directors, executive officers, including certain related individuals or organizations, and affiliates, and proposes to continue such transactions in the ordinary course of its business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing for comparable loan transactions with third parties, except as disclosed above. Except as discussed above, the extensions of credit have not involved and do not currently involve more than normal risks of collection or present other unfavorable features.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries held deposits from related parties, excluding EVERTEC, Inc. (“EVERTEC”) amounting to $632 million (2017 - $431 million).
From time to time, the Corporation, in the ordinary course of business, obtains services from related parties that have some association with the Corporation. Management believes the terms of such arrangements are consistent with arrangements entered into with independent third parties.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation made contributions of approximately $2.1 million to Fundación Banco Popular and Popular Bank Foundation, which are not-for-profit corporations dedicated to philanthropic work (2017 - $1.0 million and $1.5 million in connection with programs sponsored by the Foundations).

Note 29 - Fair value measurement
ASC Subtopic 820-10 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and disclosures. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
• Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. Valuation on these instruments does not necessitate a significant degree of judgment since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily available in an active market.
• Level 2 - Quoted prices other than those included in Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Corporation’s own assumptions about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
150 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT
The Corporation maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices when available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, the Corporation employs internally- developed models that primarily use market-based inputs including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, and credit curves, among others. Valuation adjustments are limited to those necessary to ensure that the financial instrument’s fair value is adequately representative of the price that would be received or paid in the marketplace. These adjustments include amounts that reflect counterparty credit quality, the Corporation’s credit standing, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters that are applied consistently.
The estimated fair value may be subjective in nature and may involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment for certain financial instruments. Changes in the underlying assumptions used in calculating fair value could significantly affect the results.

Fair Value on a Recurring and Nonrecurring Basis
The following fair value hierarchy tables present information about the Corporation’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:

 154 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s collateralized mortgage obligations and interest-only collateralized mortgage obligation (reported as “other”), which are classified in the “trading” category, are yield, constant prepayment rate, and weighted average life. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the constant prepayment rate will generate a directionally opposite change in the weighted average life. For example, as the average life is reduced by a higher constant prepayment rate, a lower yield will be realized, and when there is a reduction in the constant prepayment rate, the average life of these collateralized mortgage obligations will extend, thus resulting in a higher yield. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s mortgage servicing rights are constant prepayment rates and discount rates. Increases in interest rates may result in lower prepayments. Discount rates vary according to products and / or portfolios depending on the perceived risk. Increases in discount rates result in a lower fair value measurement.
Following is a description of the Corporation’s valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The disclosure requirements exclude certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts of the financial instruments disclosed do not represent management’s estimate of the underlying value of the Corporation.
Trading account debt securities and debt securities available-for-sale
• U.S. Treasury securities: The fair value of U.S. Treasury notes is based on yields that are interpolated from the constant maturity treasury curve. These securities are classified as Level 2. U.S. Treasury bills are classified as Level 1 given the high volume of trades and pricing based on those trades.
• Obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities: The Obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities include U.S. agency securities, which fair value is based on an active exchange market and on quoted market prices for similar securities. The U.S. agency securities are classified as Level 2.
• Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and political subdivisions: Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and political subdivisions include municipal bonds. The bonds are segregated and the like characteristics divided into specific sectors. Market inputs used in the evaluation process include all or some of the following: trades, bid price or spread, two sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to Treasury benchmarks,
LIBOR and swap curves, market data feeds such as those obtained from municipal market sources, discount and capital rates, and trustee reports. The municipal bonds are classified as Level 2.
• Mortgage-backed securities: Certain agency mortgage- backed securities (“MBS”) are priced based on a bond’s theoretical value derived from similar bonds defined by credit quality and market sector. Their fair value incorporates an option adjusted spread. The agency MBS are classified as Level 2. Other agency MBS such as GNMA Puerto Rico Serials are priced using an internally- prepared pricing matrix with quoted prices from local brokers dealers. These particular MBS are classified as Level 3.
• Collateralized mortgage obligations: Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) are priced based on a bond’s theoretical value derived from similar bonds defined by credit quality and market sector and for which fair value incorporates an option adjusted spread. The option adjusted spread model includes prepayment and volatility assumptions, ratings (whole loans collateral) and spread adjustments. These CMOs are classified as Level 2. Other CMOs, due to their limited liquidity, are classified as Level 3 due to the insufficiency of inputs such as broker quotes, executed trades, credit information and cash flows.
•Corporate securities (included as “other” in the “available-for-sale” category): Given that the quoted prices are for similar instruments, these securities are classified as Level 2.
• Mutual funds, other equity securities, corporate securities, U.S. Treasury bills, and interest-only strips (included as “other” in the “trading account debt securities” category): For corporate securities and mutual funds, quoted prices for these security types are obtained from broker dealers. Given that the quoted prices are for similar instruments or do not trade in highly liquid markets, these securities are classified as Level 2. The important variables in determining the prices of Puerto Rico tax-exempt mutual fund shares are net asset value, dividend yield and type of assets in the fund. All funds trade based on a relevant dividend yield taking into consideration the aforementioned variables. In addition, demand and supply also affect the price. Other equity securities that do not trade in highly liquid markets are classified as Level 2. U.S. Treasury bills are classified as Level 1 given the high volume of trades and pricing based on those trades. Given that the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable inputs, interest-only strips are classified as Level 3.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 155

Equity securities
Equity securities are comprised principally of shares in closed- ended and open-ended mutual funds. Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market at the shares’ market value. Open-ended funds are considered to be liquid, as investors can sell their shares continually to the fund and are priced at NAV. These equity securities are classified as Level 2.
Mortgage servicing rights
Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. MSRs are priced internally using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, including portfolio characteristics, prepayments assumptions, discount rates, delinquency and foreclosure rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, cost to service and other economic factors. Prepayment speeds are adjusted for the Corporation’s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior. Due to the unobservable nature of certain valuation inputs, the MSRs are classified as Level 3.
Derivatives
Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and indexed options are traded in over-the-counter active markets. These derivatives are indexed to an observable interest rate benchmark, such as LIBOR or equity indexes, and are priced using an income approach based on present value and option pricing models using observable inputs. Other derivatives are liquid and have quoted prices, such as forward contracts or “to be announced securities” (“TBAs”). All of these derivatives are classified as Level 2. The non-performance risk is determined using internally-developed models that consider the collateral held, the remaining term, and the creditworthiness of the entity that bears the risk, and uses available public data or internally- developed data related to current spreads that denote their probability of default.
Contingent consideration liability
The fair value of the true-up payment obligation (contingent consideration) to the FDIC as it relates to the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction was estimated using projected cash flows related to the loss sharing agreements at the true-up measurement date. It took into consideration the intrinsic loss estimate, asset premium/discount, cumulative shared loss payments, and the cumulative servicing amount related to the loan portfolio.
On a quarterly basis, management evaluated and revised the estimated credit loss rates that are used to determine expected cash flows on the covered loan pools. The expected credit losses on the loan pools are used to determine the loss share cash flows expected to be paid to the FDIC when the true-up payment is due.
The true-up payment obligation was discounted using a term rate consistent with the time remaining until the payment is due. The discount rate was an estimate of the sum of the risk- free benchmark rate for the term remaining before the true-up payment is due and a risk premium to account for the credit risk profile of BPPR. The risk premium was calculated based on a volume weighted average spread of the Corporation’s outstanding senior unsecured debt over the equivalent T Note. The true-up payment obligation was classified as Level 3. As disclosed in Note 10, this true-up payment obligation ended as part of the Termination Agreement with the FDIC.
Loans held-in-portfolio considered impaired under ASC Section 310-10-35 that are collateral dependent
The impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, which is derived from appraisals that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Section 310-10-35, and which could be subject to internal adjustments based on the age of the appraisal. Currently, the associated loans considered impaired are classified as Level 3.
Loans measured at fair value pursuant to lower of cost or fair value adjustments
Loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis pursuant to lower of cost or fair value were priced based on secondary market prices and discounted cash flow models which incorporate internally-developed assumptions for prepayments and credit loss estimates. These loans are classified as Level 3.
Other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets
Other real estate owned includes real estate properties securing mortgage, consumer, and commercial loans. Other foreclosed assets include primarily automobiles securing auto loans. The fair value of foreclosed assets may be determined using an external appraisal, broker price opinion, or an internal valuation. These foreclosed assets are classified as Level 3 since they are subject to internal adjustments.
Note 30 - Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which an asset or obligation could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. For those financial instruments with no quoted market prices available, fair values have been estimated using present value calculations or other valuation techniques, as well as management’s best judgment with respect to current economic conditions, including discount rates, estimates of future cash flows, and prepayment assumptions. Many of these estimates involve various assumptions and may vary significantly from amounts that could be realized in actual transactions.
156 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The fair values reflected herein have been determined based on the prevailing rate environment at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as applicable. In different interest rate environments, fair value estimates can differ significantly, especially for certain fixed rate financial instruments. In
addition, the fair values presented do not attempt to estimate the value of the Corporation’s fee generating businesses and anticipated future business activities, that is, they do not represent the Corporation’s value as a going concern.
The following tables present the carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments with their corresponding level in the fair value hierarchy. The aggregate fair value amounts of the financial instruments disclosed do not represent management’s estimate of the underlying value of the Corporation.

The notional amount of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is $ 7.5 billion and $ 7.6 billion, respectively, and represents the unused portion of credit facilities granted to customers. The notional amount of letters of credit at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is $ 29 million and $ 36 million respectively, and represents the contractual amount that is required to be paid in the event of nonperformance. The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, which are based on the fees charged to enter into those agreements, are not material to Popular’s financial statements.
Note 31 - Employee benefits
Certain employees of BPPR are covered by three non- contributory defined benefit pension plans, the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Retirement Plan and two Restoration Plans. Pension benefits are based on age, years of credited service, and final average compensation (the “Pension Plans”).
The Pension Plans are currently closed to new hires and the accrual of benefits are frozen to all participants. The Pension Plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of average final compensation and years of service as of the plan freeze date. Normal retirement age under the retirement plan is age 65 with 5 years of service. Pension costs are funded in accordance with minimum funding standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). Benefits under the Pension Plans are subject to the U.S. and Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code limits on compensation and benefits. Benefits under restoration plans restore benefits to selected employees that are limited under the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Retirement Plan due to U.S. and Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code limits and a compensation definition that excludes amounts deferred pursuant to nonqualified arrangements.
In addition to providing pension benefits, BPPR provides certain health care benefits for certain retired employees (the “OPEB Plan”). Regular employees of BPPR, hired before February 1, 2000, may become eligible for health care benefits, provided they reach retirement age while working for BPPR.
The Corporation’s funding policy is to make annual
Equity
Debt securities
Popular related securities Cash and cash equivalents
N.M - Not meaningful, less than 1%
contributions to the plans, when necessary, in amounts which fully provide for all benefits as they become due under the plans.
The Corporation’s pension fund investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. A well defined internal structure has been established to develop and implement a risk- controlled investment strategy that is targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with BPPR contributions to the fund, will maintain the fund’s ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types, such as investments in domestic and international equities and fixed income.
Equity investments include various types of stock and index funds. Also, this category includes Popular, Inc.’s common stock. Fixed income investments include U.S. Government securities and other U.S. agencies’ obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and index funds, among others. A designated committee periodically reviews the performance of the pension plans’ investments and assets allocation. The Trustee and the money managers are allowed to exercise investment discretion, subject to limitations established by the pension plans’ investment policies. The plans forbid money managers to enter into derivative transactions, unless approved by the Trustee.
The overall expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligation. The assumption has been determined by reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the plan assets, with consideration given to the distribution of the investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. This process is reevaluated at least on an annual basis and if market, actuarial and economic conditions change, adjustments to the rate of return may come into place.
The Pension Plans weighted average asset allocation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the approved asset allocation ranges, by asset category, are summarized in the table below.

 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value:
• Obligations of U.S. Government and its agencies - The fair value of Obligations of U.S. Government and agencies obligations is based on an active exchange market and is based on quoted market prices for similar securities. These securities are classified as Level 2. U.S. agency structured notes are priced based on a bond’s theoretical value from similar bonds defined by credit quality and market sector and for which the fair value incorporates an option adjusted spread in deriving their fair value. These securities are classified as Level 2, except for the governmental index funds that are measured at NAV.
• Corporate bonds and debentures - Corporate bonds and debentures are valued at fair value at the closing price reported in the active market in which the bond is traded. These securities are classified as Level 2, except for the corporate bond funds that are measured at NAV.
• Equity securities - common stocks - Equity securities with quoted market prices obtained from an active exchange market and high liquidity are classified as Level 1.
• Mortgage-backed securities - The fair value is based on trade data from brokers and exchange platforms where these instruments regularly trade. Certain agency mortgage and other asset backed securities (“MBS”) are priced based on a bond’s theoretical value from similar bonds defined by credit quality and market sector. Their fair value incorporates an option adjusted spread and prepayment projections. The agency MBS are classified as Level 2.
• Private equity investments - Private equity investments include an investment in a private equity fund. The fund value is recorded at its net realizable value which is affected by the changes in the fair market value of the investments held in the fund. This fund is classified as Level 3.
• Cash and cash equivalents - The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of the fair value since it is available on demand or due to their short- term maturity. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1.
160
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT
• Equity securities - ETF’s - Exchange Traded Funds shares • with quoted market prices obtained from an active exchange market. Highly liquid ETF’s are classified as
Level 1 while less liquid ETF’s are classified as Level 2.
Accrued investment income - Given the short-term nature of these assets, their carrying amount approximates fair value. Since there is a lack of observable inputs related to instrument specific attributes, these are reported as Level 3.
• Foreign commingled trust fund - Collective investment funds are valued at the NAV of shares held by the plan at year end.

Furthermore, although the plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The Corporation estimates the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.
To determine benefit obligation at year end, the Corporation used a weighted average of annual spot rates applied to future expected cash flows for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The following table presents the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the plans:
Discount rate for benefit obligation Initial health care cost trend rate Ultimate health care cost trend rate

As disclosed in Note 21, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation completed a $125 million accelerated share repurchase transaction (“ASR”) and, in connection therewith, received an initial delivery of 2,000,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter of 2018 and 438,180 additional shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2018. The final number of shares delivered at settlement was based on the average daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of its common stock, net of a discount, during the term of the ASR, which amounted to $51.27.
Potential common shares consist of common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock and performance shares awards using the treasury stock

method. This method assumes that the potential common shares are issued and the proceeds from exercise, in addition to the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services, are used to purchase common stock at the exercise date. The difference between the number of potential shares issued and the shares purchased is added as incremental shares to the actual number of shares outstanding to compute diluted earnings per share. Warrants, stock options, restricted stock and performance shares awards, if any, that result in lower potential shares issued than shares purchased under the treasury stock method are not included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share since their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect in earnings per common share.

 Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied by the Corporation by transferring the promised services to the customers. A service is transferred to the customer when, or as, the customer obtains control of that service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized based on the services that have been rendered to date. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized when the customer obtains control over the service. The transaction price, or the amount of revenue recognized, reflects the consideration the Corporation expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised services. In determining the transaction price, the Corporation considers the effects of variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Corporation is the principal in a transaction if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. If
the Corporation acts as principal, revenues are presented in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled and are not netted with any related expenses. On the other hand, the Corporation is an agent if it does not control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. If the Corporation acts as an agent, revenues are presented in the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled, net of related expenses.
Following is a description of the nature and timing of revenue streams from contracts with customers:
Service charges on deposit accounts
Service charges on deposit accounts are earned on retail and commercial deposit activities and include, but are not limited to, nonsufficient fund fees, overdraft fees and checks stop payment fees. These transaction-based fees are recognized at a point in time, upon occurrence of an activity or event or upon the occurrence of a condition which triggers the fee assessment. The Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 165

Debit card fees
Debit card fees include, but are not limited to, interchange fees, surcharging income and foreign transaction fees. These transaction-based fees are recognized at a point in time, upon occurrence of an activity or event or upon the occurrence of a condition which triggers the fee assessment. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the debit card payment transactions. The Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions.
Insurance fees
Insurance fees include, but are not limited to, commissions and contingent commissions. Commissions and fees are recognized when related policies are effective since the Corporation does not have an enforceable right to payment for services completed to date. An allowance is created for expected adjustments to commissions earned related to policy cancellations. Contingent commissions are recorded on an accrual basis when the amount to be received is notified by the insurance company. The Corporation is acting as an agent since it arranges for the sale of the policies and receives commissions if, and when, it achieves the sale.
Credit card fees
Credit card fees include, but are not limited to, interchange fees, additional card fees, cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and returned payments fees. Credit card fees are recognized at a point in time, upon the occurrence of an activity or an event. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit card payment transactions. The Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions.
Sale and administration of investment products
Fees from the sale and administration of investment products include, but are not limited to, commission income from the sale of investment products, asset management fees, underwriting fees, and mutual fund fees.
Commission income from investment products is recognized on the trade date since clearing, trade execution, and custody services are satisfied when the customer acquires or disposes of the rights to obtain the economic benefits of the investment products and brokerage contracts have no fixed duration and
are terminable at will by either party. The Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions since it performs the service of providing the customer with the ability to acquire or dispose of the rights to obtain the economic benefits of investment products.
Asset management fees are satisfied over time and are recognized in arrears. At contract inception, the estimate of the asset management fee is constrained from the inclusion in the transaction price since the promised consideration is dependent on the market and thus is highly susceptible to factors outside the manager’s influence. As advisor, the broker-dealer subsidiary is acting as principal.
Underwriting fees are recognized at a point in time, when the investment products are sold in the open market at a markup. When the broker-dealer subsidiary is lead underwriter, it is acting as an agent. In turn, when it is a participating underwriter, it is acting as principal.
Mutual fund fees, such as distribution fees, are considered variable consideration and are recognized over time, as the uncertainty of the fees to be received is resolved as NAV is determined and investor activity occurs. The promise to provide distribution-related services is considered a single performance obligation as it requires the provision of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. When the broker-dealer subsidiary is acting as a distributor, it is acting as principal. In turn, when it acts as third-party dealer, it is acting as an agent.
Trust fees
Trust fees are recognized from retirement plan, mutual fund administration, investment management, trustee, escrow, and custody and safekeeping services. These asset management services are considered a single performance obligation as it requires the provision of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. The performance obligation is satisfied over time, except for optional services and certain other services that are satisfied at a point in time. Revenues are recognized in arrears, when, or as, the services are rendered. The Corporation is acting as principal since, as asset manager, it has the obligation to provide the specified service to the customer and has the ultimate discretion in establishing the fee paid by the customer for the specified services.

Incentive Plan
In April 2004, the Corporation’s shareholders adopted the Popular, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan”). The Incentive Plan permits the granting of incentive awards in the form of Annual Incentive Awards, Long-term Performance Unit Awards, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Units or Performance Shares. Participants in the Incentive Plan are designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (or its delegate as determined by the Board). Employees and directors of the Corporation and/or any of its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.
Under the Incentive Plan, the Corporation has issued restricted shares, which become vested based on the employees’ continued service with Popular. Unless otherwise stated in an agreement, the compensation cost associated with the shares of restricted stock is determined based on a two-prong vesting schedule. The first part is vested ratably over five years commencing at the date of grant (the “graduated vesting portion”) and the second part is vested at termination of employment after attaining 55 years of age and 10 years of service (the “retirement vesting portion”). The graduated vesting portion is accelerated at termination of employment after attaining 55 years of age and 10 years of service. The vesting schedule for restricted shares granted on or after 2014 was modified as follows, the first part is vested ratably over four years commencing at the date of the grant (the “graduated vesting portion”) and the second part is vested at termination of employment after attaining the earlier of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age and 5 years of service (the “retirement vesting portion”). The graduated vesting portion is accelerated at termination of employment after attaining the earlier of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age and 5 years of service.

 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 167

The performance share awards consist of the opportunity to receive shares of Popular, Inc.’s common stock provided that the Corporation achieves certain goals during a three-year performance cycle. The goals will be based on two metrics weighted equally: the Relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and the Absolute Earnings per Share (“EPS”) goals. The TSR metric is considered to be a market condition under ASC 718. For equity settled awards based on a market condition, the fair value is determined as of the grant date and is not subsequently revised based on actual performance. The EPS performance metric is considered to be a performance condition under ASC 718. The fair value is determined based on the probability of achieving the EPS goal as of each reporting period. The TSR and EPS metrics are equally weighted and work independently. The number of shares that will ultimately vest ranges from 50% to a 150% of target based on both market (TSR) and performance (EPS) conditions. The performance shares vest at the end of the three-year performance cycle. The vesting is accelerated at termination of employment after attaining the earlier of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age and 5 years of service.
The following table summarizes the restricted stock and performance shares activity under the Incentive Plan for members of management.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation recognized $ 6.9 million of restricted stock expense related to management incentive awards, with a tax benefit of $1.1 million (2017 - $ 5.6 million, with a tax benefit of $1.1 million; 2016 - $ 7.3 million, with a tax benefit of $1.4 million). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the restricted stock vested was $6.0 million at grant date and $8.0 million at vesting date. This triggers a windfall of $0.7 million that was recorded as a reduction on income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Corporation recognized $5.6 million of performance shares expense, with a tax benefit of $ 0.4 million (2017 - $1.2 million, with a tax benefit of $ 0.1 million; 2016 - $1.5 million, with a tax benefit of $0.1 million). The total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards to members of management at December 31, 2018 was $ 8.3 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted- average period of 2.3 years.

[1] For the year ended December 31,2018, includes the impact of the Tax Closing Agreement entered into in connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted Transaction.
  Income tax expense of $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the impact of the Termination Agreement with the FDIC. In June 2012, the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury and the Corporation entered into a Tax Closing Agreement (the “Tax Closing Agreement”) to clarify the tax treatment related to the loans acquired in the FDIC Transaction in accordance with the provisions of the Puerto Rico Tax Code. The Tax Closing Agreement provides that these loans are capital assets and any principal amount collected in excess of the amount paid for such loans will be taxed as a capital gain. The Tax Closing Agreement further provides that the Corporation’s tax liability upon the termination of the Shared-Loss Agreements be calculated based on the “deemed sale” of the underlying loans. As a result, in connection with the Termination Agreement with the FDIC, the Corporation recognized an additional income tax expense of $49.8 million associated with the “deemed sale” incremental tax liability at the capital gains rate per the Tax Closing
Agreement. In addition, the Corporation recognized an income tax benefit of $158.7 million related to the increase in deferred tax assets due to increase in the tax basis of the loans as a result of the “deemed sale” for a net tax benefit of $108.9 million. Also, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $45.0 million related to the gain resulting from the Termination Agreement, mainly related to the reversal of net deferred tax liability of the true-up payment obligation and the FDIC Loss Share Asset.
On December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No. 257 of 2018, which amended the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code to, among other things, reduce the Puerto Rico corporate income tax rate from 39% to 37.5%. The Corporation recognized $27.7 million of income tax expense as a result of a reduction in the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset related to its Puerto Rico operations, due to aforementioned reduction in tax rate at which it expects to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset.
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 169

On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the “Tax Cuts and Job Acts” (the “Act”), which resulted in a reduction in the U.S. operations net deferred tax asset with a corresponding charge to income tax expense of $168.4 million primarily for a reduction in the marginal corporate income tax rate. Among the most significant
provisions of the 2017 Federal Tax Reform was the reduction of the U.S. federal income tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a single tax rate of 21%. The Corporation has completed its evaluation of the impact of the Act and has recorded all of the correspondingadjustments.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Significant components of the Corporation’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows:

    170 POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

The net deferred tax asset shown in the table above at December 31, 2018 is reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as $1.0 billion in net deferred tax assets (in the “other assets” caption) (2017 - $1.0 billion in deferred tax asset in the “other assets” caption) and $926 thousands in deferred tax liabilities (in the “other liabilities” caption) (2017 - $1.3 million in deferred tax liabilities in the “other liabilities” caption), reflecting the aggregate deferred tax assets or liabilities of individual tax-paying subsidiaries of the Corporation.
Included as part of the other carryforwards available are $42.2 million related to contributions to BPPR’s qualified pension plan that have no expiration date. Additionally, the deferred tax asset related to the NOLs outstanding at December 31, 2018 expires as follows:
deferred tax asset for the remaining carryforward period, together with the historical level of book income adjusted by permanent differences. Management will continue to evaluate the realization of the deferred tax asset each quarter and adjust as any changes arise.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s net deferred tax assets related to its Puerto Rico operations amounted to $721million.
The Corporation’s Puerto Rico Banking operation is not in a cumulative loss position and has sustained profitability for the three year period ended December 31, 2018. This is considered a strong piece of objectively verifiable positive evidence that out weights any negative evidence considered by management in the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset. Based on this evidence and management’s estimate of future taxable income, the Corporation has concluded that it is more likely than not that such net deferred tax asset of the Puerto Rico Banking operations will be realized.
The Holding Company operation is in a cumulative loss position, taking into account taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, for the three years period ending December 31, 2018. Management expect these losses will be a trend in future years. This objectively verifiable negative evidence is considered by management a strong negative evidence that will suggest that income in future years will be insufficient to support the realization of all deferred tax asset. After weighting of all positive and negative evidence management concluded, as of the reporting date, that it is more likely than not that the Holding Company will not be able to realize any portion of the deferred tax assets, considering the criteria of ASC Topic 740. Accordingly, the Corporation has maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of $90 million as of December 2018.
Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. However, certain subsidiaries that are organized as limited liability companies with a partnership election are treated as pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes. The Code provides a dividends-received deduction of 100% on dividends received from “controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.
The Corporation’s subsidiaries in the United States file a consolidated federal income tax return. The intercompany settlement of taxes paid is based on tax sharing agreements which generally allocate taxes to each entity based on a separate return basis.

   A deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018 the net deferred tax asset of the U.S. operations amounted to $734 million with a valuation allowance of approximately $406 million, for a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of approximately $328 million. As of December 31, 2018, after weighting all positive and negative evidence, the Corporation concluded that it is more likely than not that approximately $328 million of the deferred tax asset from the U.S. operations, comprised mainly of net operating losses, will be realized. The Corporation based this determination on its estimated earnings available to realize the
POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 171

The following table presents a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits.
After consideration of the effect on U.S. federal tax of unrecognized U.S. state tax benefits, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including U.S. and Puerto Rico that, if recognized, would affect the Corporation’s effective tax rate, was approximately $9.0 million at December 31, 2018 (2017 - $9.0 million).
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions, expiration of open income tax returns due to the statute of limitations, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of examinations, litigation and legislative activity, and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions.
The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in Puerto Rico, the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. states and political subdivisions, and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, the following years remain subject to examination in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction – 2015 and thereafter and in the Puerto Rico jurisdiction – 2014 and thereafter. The Corporation anticipates a reduction in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, which could amount to approximately $4.7 million.

    At December 31, 2018, the total amount of interest recognized in the statement of financial condition approximated $2.8 million (2017 - $2.7 million). The total interest expense recognized during 2018 was $615 thousand net of the reduction of $483 thousand due to the expiration of the statute of limitations (2017 - $598 thousand). Management determined that, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no need to accrue for the payment of penalties. The Corporation’s policy is to report interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, while the penalties, if any, are reported in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Note 39 - Segment reporting
The Corporation’s corporate structure consists of two reportable segments – Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. These reportable segments pertain only to the continuing operations of Popular, Inc.
Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the organizational structure, which focuses primarily on the markets the segments serve, as well as on the products and services offered by the segments.
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico:
Given that Banco Popular de Puerto Rico constitutes a significant portion of the Corporation’s results of operations and total assets at December 31, 2018, additional disclosures are provided for the business areas included in this reportable segment, as described below:
• Commercial banking represents the Corporation’s banking operations conducted at BPPR, which are targeted mainly to corporate, small and middle size businesses. It includes aspects of the lending and depository businesses, as well as other finance and advisory services. BPPR allocates funds across business areas based on duration matched transfer pricing at market rates. This area also incorporates income related with the investment of excess funds, as well as a proportionate share of the investment function of BPPR.
• Consumer and retail banking represents the branch banking operations of BPPR which focus on retail clients. It includes the consumer lending business operations of BPPR, as well as the lending operations of Popular Auto and Popular Mortgage. Popular Auto focuses on auto and lease financing, while Popular Mortgage focuses principally on residential mortgage loan originations. During 2018, the Reliable brand was transferred to Popular, Inc. and is being used by Popular Auto. The consumer and retail banking area also incorporates income related with the investment of excess funds from the branch network, as well as a proportionate share of the investment function of BPPR.
• Other financial services
management service units of BPPR, the brokerage and investment banking operations of Popular Securities, and the insurance agency and reinsurance businesses of Popular Insurance, Popular Insurance V.I., Popular Risk Services, and Popular Life Re. Most of the services that are provided by these subsidiaries generate profits based on fee income. Popular Insurance V.I. was dissolved on December 31, 2018.
Popular U.S.:
Popular U.S. reportable segment consists of the banking operations of Popular Bank (PB), E-LOAN, Inc., Popular Equipment Finance, Inc. and Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A. PB operates through a retail branch network in the U.S. mainland under the name of Popular, while E-LOAN, Inc. supported PB’s deposit gathering through its online platform until March 31, 2017, when said operations were transferred to Popular Direct, a division of PB. During 2017, the E-LOAN brand was transferred to Popular Inc. and is being used by BPPR to offer personal loans through an online platform. Popular Equipment Finance, Inc. also holds a running-off loan portfolio as this subsidiary ceased originating loans during 2009. Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A. offers investment and insurance services across the PB branch network.
The Corporate group consists primarily of the holding companies Popular, Inc., Popular North America, Popular International Bank and certain of the Corporation’s investments accounted for under the equity method, including EVERTEC and Centro Financiero BHD, Leon. The Corporate group also includes the expenses of certain corporate areas that are identified as critical to the organization including: Finance, Risk Management and Legal.
The accounting policies of the individual operating segments are the same as those of the Corporation. Transactions between reportable segments are primarily conducted at market rates, resulting in profits that are eliminated for reporting consolidated results of operations.
Effective on January 1, 2019, the Corporation’s management changed the measurement basis for its reportable segments. Historically, for management reporting purposes, the

POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 173

Corporation had reversed the effect of the intercompany billings from Popular Inc., holding company, to its subsidiaries for certain services or expenses incurred on their behalf. In addition, the Corporation used to reflect an income tax expense allocation for several of its subsidiaries which are Limited Liability Companies (“LLCs”) and had made an election to be treated as a pass through entities for income tax purposes. The Corporation’s management has determined to discontinue making these adjustments, effective on January 1, 2019, for purposes of its management and reportable segment reporting. The Corporation will reflect these changes in the measurement of the reportable segments’ results prospectively beginning on January 1, 2019.

POPULAR, INC. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 187

Note 42 - Subsequent events
On February 28, 2019, the Corporation entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction of $250 million with respect to its common stock, which was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction. Accordingly, as a result of the receipt of the initial shares, the Corporation recognized in shareholders’ equity approximately $200 million in treasury stock and $50 million as a reduction of capital surplus. The Corporation expects to further adjust its treasury stock and capital surplus accounts to reflect the delivery or receipt of cash or shares upon the termination of the ASR agreement, which will depend on the average price of the Corporation’s shares during the term of the ASR.
