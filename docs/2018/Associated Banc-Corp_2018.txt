Dear Shareholders,
2018 was a historic and momentous year for Associated Banc-Corp.
We strengthened our company through organic growth and with the acquisitions and successful integrations of Bank Mutual, Diversified Insurance Solutions and Anderson Insurance Agency. We sharpened our focus around the customer experience—prioritizing investments, products and services to meet changing needs and expectations. We extended our outreach, defining new opportunities to stimulate economic development and promote stronger communities.
Our financial performance was strong. We grew both our loan portfolio and fee businesses. We finished the year with record deposit levels and nearly $34 billion in assets.
Our operational efficiency improved for the seventh consecutive year, demonstrating our acquisition discipline and commitment to controlling costs. We were effective in our credit and risk management practices, finishing the year with zero provision for credit losses.
Collectively, these improvements drove earnings per common share to $1.89, a 33% increase from 2017 and a 50% increase from two years ago.
Our plans call for considered and thoughtful growth of our company. This comes in two ways: 1) we continue to cultivate traditional sales growth through our relationships with customers, the expansion of our salesforce and investments in technology; and 2) we pursue targeted acquisition opportunities where they make sense.
2018 Highlights
  We’ve lowered our a7djusted efficiency ratio(1)
years and were able to improve our adjusted efficiency ratio more than
consecutive
200 basis points
from 2017.
Average loans of approximately
Our net income available to common equity was
$23 billion and record average deposits
$323 million, and earnings per common equity share increased
of more than
$24 billion were up
33% to $1.89.
10%
The company repurchased $240 million of common stock and increased dividends per common share by 24%
from 2017,
benefiting from organic and acquired
activity during the year.
(1) The adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure - See table 26 in Part II, item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and page 10 of the financial tables in the 2018 earnings press release published January 24, 2019, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization and acquisition related costs, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net, and acquisition related costs. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, and analysts to provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods.

GROWING OUR CORE BUSINESS
Associated proudly serves more than 1 million customers— individuals, families and businesses—providing a comprehensive mix of products and services to help them manage their finances, conveniently conduct transactions, and protect and promote personal wealth and business growth.
Our commitment to the customer experience and the diversity of our portfolio has enabled us to increase our value to customers and shareholders, while maintaining a conservative credit culture.
Over the past several years, Associated has invested in the expansion of our commercial banking presence. Commercial and business average loans increased 7% in 2018 from 2017, and have nearly doubled over the past decade. While the majority of that growth was driven by our specialty lending verticals, manufacturing and wholesale trade remain our largest industry exposure.
Most of our commercial relationships are initiated through credit, then deepened with additional financial and risk management solutions over time. In 2018, we expanded our commercial banking team with experienced relationship managers in key markets. We expect these new colleagues to bring increasing value to existing and new customers in the Upper Midwest and through select national businesses.
To meet the complex needs of these customers, we plan
to make significant improvements to our digital services in 2019. Expected features include an enhanced suite of online and mobile services for account reporting, funds transfer, positive pay and user administration.
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) average loans increased approximately 10% in 2018 from 2017. CRE accounts for a fifth of our total loans. Serving customers from 12 offices in eight states, our CRE model remains focused on working with proven developers. This has allowed us to successfully grow the business while remaining well diversified by geography, property type and borrower.
Over the past three years, our wealth management team, which focuses primarily on commercial, executive and professional customers, has undergone a series of organizational changes to better align its business units, enhance capabilities and deepen customer relationships.
Growth in 2018 was primarily driven by investment management and advisory fee revenues, reflecting the strength of the underlying equity markets and the full-year contribution of Whitnell & Co., the high net worth family office services firm we acquired in late 2017. In addition,
4
our insurance activity was boosted by our 2018 acquisitions of Diversified Insurance Solutions and Anderson Insurance Agency, which added to our revenues.
Consumer deposits remained strong as we successfully retained and grew lower-cost balances. Our sports affinity programs continue to be effective in adding new customers. By the end of last year, more than 40% of active personal checking accounts had affinity debit cards.
The majority of that group is tied to our long relationship with the Green Bay Packers. We have been the Bank of the Packers since their founding in 1919. We also have affinity programs with the Milwaukee BrewersTM, Minnesota Wild® and Wisconsin BadgersTM.
Our company was once again recognized as Wisconsin’s #1 Mortgage Lender and continues to gain market share in Illinois and Minnesota. Residential mortgages, which represent approximately 36% of our average total loans, benefited from organic growth and the acquisition of Bank Mutual.
We continue to improve our market position and drive profitability through our community markets strategy,

launched five years ago. Based in select midsized markets, this banking model combines the localized approach of traditional community banks with the efficiencies and full services of our larger organization.
Benefiting from both organic and acquired activity, our community markets’ deposit balance has increased approximately 34% since 2014. We expect continued investment in these markets will improve our ability to grow organically while helping to successfully integrate customers joining us through acquisitions.
We’ve invested significant time and effort to ensure regulatory compliance and manage risk. Our current regulatory and
risk management position is positive, and we will remain focused on our compliance efforts as we continue to grow the company.
GROWING THROUGH TARGETED ACQUISITIONS
Our acquisition strategy is driven in large part by current industry dynamics. There is an imperative for Associated to build scale to facilitate investment in services and technology that enhance the customer experience. Doing so helps us remain competitive with the largest banks with which we compete.
The 2018 acquisition and successful integration of Bank Mutual provided an opportunity to increase our Wisconsin presence and improve the scale of our operations. There was a significant amount of physical overlap, with approximately 50% of Bank Mutual branches being located within one mile of an Associated Bank location. In line with our expectations, we realized approximately 45% cost savings after converting systems, products, services and branches last June.
The cultural synergies of our two companies, coupled with the dedication of our colleagues, also helped ensure a
smooth transition for customers. Even with the rationalization of branches, customers now have access to a broader network of locations, including branches in nearly a dozen additional communities.
Central to this acquisition, we proved our ability to acquire
a bank and integrate it successfully, without disrupting the customer experience or taking on significant additional staff. We continue to be pleased with our deposit retention rates, which stood at approximately 90% at the end of 2018.
We learned much from our Bank Mutual approach and see the acquisition of the Wisconsin branch banking operations of The Huntington National Bank, announced in December
2018, as an opportunity to both capitalize on our experience and replay our success. This similar, although smaller, transaction will strengthen our Wisconsin presence, and is expected to add more than 60,000 deposit accounts and 33,000 households to Associated.
We expect to add 14 branches to the combined companies’ network and expand into 13 new communities during the second quarter of 2019. With this change, Huntington’s Wisconsin customers will benefit from our broader branch network and 24/7/365 assistance from our Customer Care team. We expect opportunities to deepen these customer relationships over time.
In 2018, Associated also acquired Anderson Insurance Agency, an independent firm based in Minneapolis, and Diversified Insurance Solutions, one of Wisconsin’s leading insurance brokers. Along with providing a lift in noninterest income, the addition of these established firms helps expand our insurance and risk management services in some of
our largest metropolitan markets, and furthers our strategy to drive shareholder value through a diverse set
of specialty businesses.

2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT
 ENHANCING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Our colleagues view the opportunity to serve our customers as their top priority. They know that behind every relationship is an individual, family or business owner who is looking to Associated to provide the right solutions for their financial and risk management needs. Our teams focus on getting to know our customers, their unique situations and how they want to interact with us.
While banking continues to be a relationship business, our customers expect advanced online and mobile banking services to conduct their business.
Our investments in digital services and our branch network continue to benefit our consumer and business banking customers. Since upgrading our consumer online and mobile banking services in February 2018, we’ve seen more than
a 30% increase in mobile banking customer satisfaction through our customer experience surveys. Nearly half of all Associated customer transactions are now done online, and mobile banking is our fastest growing service channel.
Customers appreciate features such as facial recognition and fingerprint authentication for mobile sign-in, personal financial management tools and a more user-friendly design. Beyond these enhancements, the 2018 upgrade includes advanced security features and improves our company’s ability to regularly roll out new features in a time- and cost- efficient manner.
In early 2019, these online and mobile services were also rolled out to small business customers whose business
6
needs aligned with the platform’s services. Business and commercial customers with more complex needs will receive a more advanced suite of online and mobile services later this year.
Across our industry, digitally based person-to-person transactions are increasing. Consumer adoption is expected to be above 50% in 2019. To meet this growing demand, Associated expects to upgrade its service to the Zelle platform during the first half of the year.
We are investing heavily to enhance our digital sales platforms and improve the overall customer experience. Upgrades to our online and mobile “uOpen” platform launched in early 2019. These updates speed up the consumer deposit application process by approximately 30% and reduce the chance for input errors. Additional digital upgrades for enhancing small business and mortgage loan applications are also planned for 2019.
Recognizing the importance of all our customer touchpoints, we regularly measure the customer experience across our digital, branch and telephone channels. Our branch customer experience scores reached a new high in October as our colleagues worked to deliver superior service. The addition of our third 24/7/365 customer call center extended our ability to respond to customers’ needs real-time, often in
one call.

 STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES
One of the most important things we do to keep our company healthy and vibrant is to proactively support economic development within our communities. We pride ourselves on being a strong community partner, actively coordinating resources for the benefit of the communities we serve.
In 2018, Associated announced a $2.4 billion Community Commitment Plan, covering three years from 2018 through 2020. The plan, which is an extension of a similar plan adopted in 2016, sets forth our company’s commitments to minority communities, low- to moderate-income communities and small businesses in our three-state branch footprint of Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota.
Highlights of our financial commitments include $1.4 billion for residential mortgages, $600 million for community development loans, $425 million for small business loans and $8 million in donations.
Our colleagues work in tandem with community leaders, nonprofit organizations, governmental entities and other community representatives to extend our reach into underserved markets and to ensure our coordinated efforts support the most important economic development issues in the markets we serve.
Associated’s Colleague Resource Groups also help enhance engagement with our customers and communities. Each
of these six groups works to create greater organizational awareness of and takes specific actions to address the
unique needs of diverse populations within our company
and our markets. Their efforts have resulted in initiatives that influence workforce development; workplace culture, policies and programs; and marketplace practices.
This work is extended by our colleagues who volunteer their time and expertise. In 2018, colleagues logged more than 73,000 hours of volunteer time, worth $1.7 million. Since 2012, our recorded volunteer hours were valued at more than $10 million in donated time. In addition, for the eighth consecutive year our colleagues joined together to raise more than $1 million for the United Way.
“One of the most important things we do to keep our
company healthy and vibrant is to proactively support
economic development within our communities.”

2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT
 DEVELOPING FUTURE LEADERS
Ultimately, our momentum and success is driven by the passion of our people who strive to make our customers’ experiences and our communities even better. Through a variety of programs, we work to ensure colleagues have the necessary tools and resources to achieve career and personal goals.
We make substantial investments in colleague education and have specialized and leadership development programs designed to help colleagues advance their careers. In 2018, 21% of colleagues advanced their careers within Associated, including more than 570 internal promotions.
We have been very strategic about succession planning, and strive to fill positions from within the company, whenever possible. It gives us great pride to say that 12 of our executive committee members have been promoted from within our company. This is a testament to the high caliber of our colleagues and talent development resources.
In September 2018, Associated announced the promotion of Michael Meinolf to Associated’s executive team as Chief Information Officer. Mike joined Associated in 2015 at which time he was responsible for the development and support of application systems for all major business units and significant third-party vendor relationships.
Judith Docter retired from her role as Chief Human Resources Officer in March of this year. During her 27
years with the company, Judy has been instrumental in developing the company’s talent programs, many of which have helped Associated be recognized as an employer of choice within our markets and by special interest groups. Judy is succeeded by Angie DeWitt. Angie joined Associated in 2008 and has more than 26 years experience, including multiple leadership roles in finance and human resources.
DELIVERING VALUE
We feel very fortunate to be a part of Associated’s 157-year journey. The work of our colleagues and management team continues to transform our company and deliver increasing value to all of our stakeholders—customers, colleagues, communities and shareholders. We love to share our story, and have included additional highlights on the pages
that follow.
Thank you for your continued support and confidence in Associated. We enter 2019 with momentum and opportunity. Our capital management priorities remain consistent— support organic growth, pay a competitive dividend, pursue in-market, cost takeout acquisitions and deploy capital through share repurchases.
We will continue investing in the future of our company— improving our ability to serve our customers, grow our talent and strengthen our communities. Doing so positions us to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
Sincerely,
Philip B. Flynn

Throughout our history, Associated has been proud to play an active role in helping our communities grow and prosper. Ultimately, we believe this positions us to better serve our customers, creates opportunity for our colleagues and provides greater value for our shareholders.
We focus on where we can best align our resources. This includes leveraging our expertise and financial support to promote affordable housing, provide small business lending and advance neighborhood development. To extend our reach, we collaborate with local leaders, various nonprofit organizations, governmental entities and other community representatives. These efforts are complemented by our colleagues who volunteer their time to help strengthen our communities.
Core to our efforts is the promotion of homeownership and the revitalization of neighborhoods. We offer mortgage products focused on first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income borrowers. Some products also provide significant value to qualifying borrowers through direct closing-cost and down-payment subsidies.
DEVELOPING STRONGER COMMUNITIES
Associated and members of its Chicago-based Community Advisory Council are bringing together resources in a special, coordinated way to advance economic development in the Bronzeville neighborhood.
Located along Lake Michigan about four miles from downtown Chicago, this neighborhood began as home to many of the millions who fled the South during the Great Migration of the early 1900s. Today it is a growing center of African American history and culture.
As part of this effort, Associated is providing investments and grants and is working with local community organizations to stimulate business growth, promote homeownership, and provide financial education programming and outreach.
      Bronzeville Branch Chicago, IL
    Located in a south side neighborhood of Chicago, the Bronzeville branch offers services to consumers and businesses.

Making Community a Team Sport
Our sports affinity programs, and our long-term relationships with the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee BrewersTM and Minnesota Wild®, have proven to be effective in adding new customers and creating new connections with our communities.
We have been the Bank of the Packers since their founding in 1919. In 2018, to celebrate our 100-year relationship, Associated sponsored Lambeau Field Live. This traveling exhibit took the Packers and Associated on the road, stopping at major venues across the state of Wisconsin.
Closer to the home field, Associated and the Packers, in partnership with the Green Bay Area Public School District, hosted an annual Stock the BoxTM pep rally to benefit Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin. Each school’s band competed to collect the largest food donation. All were awarded with grants to benefit their music program. Now in its third year, the program has inspired hundreds
of students to do goodwill in their communities and helped secure 22,000 pounds of food.
For the fourth consecutive year, Associated and the Milwaukee Brewers Community Foundation teamed up to sponsor Hits for Homes at Miller Park.
This program has helped provide more than $400,000 of financial support to low- to moderate-income homeowners through Housing Resources, Inc. (HRI). In addition to monetary contributions, Associated volunteers hosted Stock the Box Tool Drives at Miller Park and with local business clients to benefit HRI’s Tool Loan Program. This program gives homeowners low-cost access to tools to maintain their homes and sustain their neighborhoods.
To help families dealing with Autism, the Associated Forward Abilities Network, a colleague resource group focused on supporting individuals with disabilities, teamed up with the Autism Society of Minnesota (AuSM) and the Minnesota Wild to host “Into the Wild.” The unique event was designed to celebrate the
fan experience and the students participating. Each sponsor brought something different to the day, including the Minnesota Wild practice and tour, personal finance activities with Associated volunteers and “I am Awesome” activities with AuSM staff members.

2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT
The Power of Inclusion
  Supporting Service
“Having such strong support allowed me the mentality to focus on the tasks at hand when I was overseas.”
–Tom Irizarry
Associated supports veterans, military personnel and their families through programs including leave time, retention of benefits and full pay for colleagues
on training and active military duty. In addition the Deployment Trip Program provides financial assistance to colleagues visiting a loved one prior to deployment.
It was for these reasons that 17-year colleague and U.S. Army Reserve Sergeant First Class Tom Irizarry knew that work was one less thing he had to worry about when he deployed to the Baltic States last year. Not only was his job secure, his fellow colleagues made every effort to stay in touch with emails, cards and care packages.
We are very fortunate to have diverse, committed teams of colleagues who are capable, determined and empowered to drive our company forward. We view the act of building and advancing an inclusive culture as a business imperative, critical to our success. Our results show in the words of our colleagues who have described our culture as diverse, inclusive and transparent in our past three annual workplace surveys. Eighty-three percent of all colleagues participated in the survey in 2018.
In 2018, we advanced our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) efforts by providing general D&I training for all colleagues and specialized management training that focused on unconscious bias and leading diverse teams. More than 240 leaders completed the specialized training during the year.
We expanded our partnerships with organizations like Tempo Milwaukee and FUEL Milwaukee to build a diverse talent pool for middle- and senior-level positions. Our focused efforts resulted in a 37% increase in minority applicants for professional level positions and 40% of jobs being filled with minority candidates in Milwaukee. We also enhanced career path planning and training to help colleagues advance their careers at Associated.
We exceeded the OFCCP-established 7% individuals with disability workforce requirement.(1) We also partnered with various community organizations to gain knowledge on workforce programs that will help connect future talent with Associated.
A shining strength of our D&I culture continues to be our six Colleague Resource Groups. Each group works to create greater organizational awareness of and takes specific actions to address the unique needs of diverse populations within our company and our markets.
With more than 43% of colleagues participating, these groups’ efforts have resulted in initiatives that influence workforce development; workplace culture, policies and programs; and marketplace practices. In addition, the groups engage with nonprofit community partners, other businesses and organizations to help ensure we are building
an inclusive environment for our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve.

(1) Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OCFFP) has defined a disability as a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity.

Managing Our Carbon Footprint
We closely consider our environmental impact in many aspects of our company’s operations.
We believe creating energy efficient buildings is the most effective method for reducing our branch network’s carbon footprint. Our newly constructed branches exceed the code required energy performance standards by providing an R-value of 13.5 in excess of what is required under the current energy code, and the HVAC systems are selected to be high efficiency units.
In addition, we strive to use “green” materials wherever possible. For example, our flooring, wall, ceiling and countertop materials are made with either recyclable content or high life-cycle content. We also use occupancy sensors; have implemented power management processes on all personal computers, monitors and printers; and use Energy Star compliant appliances to manage energy use.
We have an aggressive LED lighting program, and have been retrofitting our branch locations where necessary. We’ve complemented this effort with the testing of HVAC equipment in some of our larger facilities. Using our 2015 expenses as a baseline, we expect approximately $500 thousand in annual savings across all locations updated in the past three years.
Finally, through our shredding efforts that protect the environment and our customers’ information security, 1,000 tons of materials were recycled during the year.
Investing in Renewable Energy
      Associated’s Power & Utilities team supports clients’ renewable energy projects.
Associated leverages its financial resources, insights and expertise to support renewable energy projects throughout the United States. Since 2012, our Power and Utilities specialized lending group has made over $900 million in total credit commitments
to support more than 30 wind, solar
and hydroelectric projects, representing cumulative generating capacity in excess of 6,500 megawatts.
These projects, spanning across 15 states, generate a significant number of jobs
in their surrounding communities while providing clean, sustainable power.
